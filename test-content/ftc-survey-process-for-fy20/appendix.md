# Appendix

## Internal FTC Operations Process for Sending Surveys

### High-level steps

1. FM/FE identifies which customer contacts are survey eligible in FTOP.

2. CXP Ops downloads list of all survey eligible contacts and reviews to determine which ones need to be surveyed (e.g. removes those that have already been sent surveys, identifies those with missing information, donâ€™t meet criteria, and so on).

3. CXP Ops finalizes customer list and sends to Qualtrics to distribute survey.

4. CXP downloads results from Qualtrics and will report via various channels
