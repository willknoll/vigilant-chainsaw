# Mid-Touch Reactive

## SME Type

FT Core Teams SME

## Scope

- Address questions and provide guidance
- No customer meetings or workshops delivered

## Eligibility

- <2,000 active SfBO users
- Customers have 500+ paid seats

## Accountability/Actions

1. Direct customers to [best practices](https://aka.ms/skypetoteams), [planning guidance](https://aka.ms/SkypeToTeamsPlanning), [free training](https://aka.ms/TeamsLiveTraining) and [downloadable assets](https://aka.ms/UpgradeSuccesskit) on Microsoft Docs to help them get started.

2. Review [Upgrade FAQs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/faq-journey).

3. Post questions in [FastTrack-M365> Teams and SFBO](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2b225617cf0948a9b23dc4b9e5db7525%40thread.skype/Teams%2520and%2520SFBO?groupId=4be32c1a-84cf-43d6-b8a2-9986a996b0a5&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) channel. Teams SMEs/Engineering experts are monitoring and can help guide.

>[!NOTE]
>FastTrack: If FM/FEs haven’t received a response within 24 hours or still cannot get a customer’s issue resolved through the [FAQs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/faq-journey) or collaboration [channels](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2b225617cf0948a9b23dc4b9e5db7525%40thread.skype/Teams%2520and%2520SFBO?groupId=4be32c1a-84cf-43d6-b8a2-9986a996b0a5&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47), you can engage a Teams SME for customers (500+ SFBO seats only).  

4. Submit a SME request at the [FTC Resource Request site](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/SitePages/FTC%20Resource%20Request.aspx).

**CHANGE:** In FY20, all technical requests for Teams SMEs should be submitted by an FE/FTA to reduce any unnecessary clarification discussions.

>[!NOTE]
>Given the limited number of SME resources available in FY20, if a SME is assigned, he/she will focus on addressing the specific issue/question identified and will not remain working with the customer for a long period of time.
