# Conduct Engagement Completion Discussion (migration)

Phase: **Migrate**  
Motions: **RFA**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Conduct Engagement Completion Discussion process completes the engagement with the customer for the workload or workloads submitted through a Request for Assistance (RFA) and concludes the working relationship between the FastTrack Manager and the customer. 
This process is executed as part of the RFA
motion and when migration is complete.​  

## Objectives

  - Customer has education and knowledge on completing the RFA form for
    future requests/inquiries.  
  - Customer has tools for the successful adoption of newly implemented
    cloud services.  
  - Customer is satisfied with the FastTrack engagement.  
  - Customer engagement is closed.  

## Approach

### Prepare for Engagement Discussion Conversation (migration)

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **RFA**  
Applies To: **All Services**

After migration is complete, you need to prepare for the customer
conversation.

If account team information exists:  

- Send an email to the account team contacts, letting them know that migration is complete. Use [ATU email template](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/ftccm/ESFoCde18MRBvb0N8VcQb3IBi1xr9_GVRg_33yEelscadw), which encompasses the following:
  - Direction to have engagement completion review with the customer.
  - Reinforcement that the FM will disengage after the review.
  - ​Support from the account team in the engagement completion process.
- If there is no account team information, follow guidance in *Conduct Engagement Completion Discussion* section.  

Refer to the [RFA Customer Engagement Completion Discussion FAQ](https://aka.ms/RFAFAQ) for guidance on how to execute Customer Engagement Completion Discussion process and address customer unique scenarios or concerns. 

### Conduct Engagement Completion Discussion (migration)

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **RFA**  
Applies To: **All Services**

The engagement completion discussion should be held during the
customer’s existing cadence. Note that if you are supporting an RFA
customer who has requested assistance for multiple services in one
request, you will need to complete this process as you complete
onboarding of each workload.  However, the FM will only disengage from
the customer, once the last service is complete. ​  

Refer to the [RFA Customer Engagement Completion Discussion FAQ](https://aka.ms/RFAFAQ) for guidance on how to execute Customer Engagement Completion Discussion process and address customer unique scenarios or concerns. 

The engagement completion discussion should cover the following:  

- Review completed activities.
- Identify if customer is ready to onboard an additional workload.  
  - If customer is ready to deploy another workload:  
    - Provide customer instructions on how to submit an RFA request.  
    - Demo how to fill out RFA form.  
  - If customer is not ready to start onboarding an additional workload proceed to next step.  

- After conducting engagement completion discussion, send the customer a follow up email. Use [Customer email template​](https://aka.ms/AA7628i).  
- Mark *Disengagement Process is Complete (migration)* task.  
- Set FTOP status accordingly:  
  - Update notes with latest status.  
  - Set the next action date to 12/31 of the following year.  
  - Send an email to the Assignment team to request the tenant be moved to one of these queues:  
    - FTCQ Inactive Americas  
    - FTCQ Inactive APJ  
    - FTCQ Inactive EMEA  
  - FM unassigns himself/herself from tenant.  
    - *Note: FM should not remove his/her name until the account has been successfully assigned to one of the aforementioned queues*.
