# Determine Onboarding Channel

Program Manager: **Maria Conceição**  
Phase: **Assignment**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](../includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Determine Onboarding Channel process occurs by reaching out to the
Account Team, Partner and Customer to determine intent, or reaching out
after processing an RFA. Then, the FastTrack Manager identifies whether
a tenant qualifies for assignment to either a FastTrack Ready Partner or
to Microsoft delivery resources. 

## Objectives

  - Assign tenant to Delivery and FTR Partner when FTR Partner is
    already engaged or, for an FTR Partner referral when the customer
    wants assistance from Microsoft FastTrack Center with onboarding and
    adoption. 
  - Assign tenant options when unable to gather intent with DIBS, and/or
    FTC assistance is not needed. 

## Approach

### Proactive Assignment Process

Primary Role: **Engagement FM**  
Applies To: **Core Onboarding**

Proactive Process has 11 options to assign commerce tenants. See
[Customer Engagement
Process](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/ftccm/opsplaybook/EaY2AoIg1nxNlf2rhGGxoK0BcTKAQLJfZYw4GzT2mVoZzQ?rtime=VVLTOJpf1kg)
for instructions in the Proactive Assignment Options section and refer
to [DIBS
Flowchart](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:u:/t/ftccm/Efubn00G7A9CkF064bppMeEB9FUslhTQ_MogK0yZySYttQ?rtime=BrNnSJpf1kg)
for guidance on actions when DIBS is obtained and when you do not
receive DIBS. 

The following 4 options are used when a partner is engaged, or the
customer wants assistance from FTC: 

  -  FastTrack Ready Partner is already engaged (regardless if DIBS
    provided)
      - Onboarding RM = FTRP Name from FastTrack Ready Partner List 
      - Onboarding Partner Success Manager = PSM Full Name from the
        FastTrack Ready Partner List
      - Partner RM = FTP Name from the FastTrack Partner List
  - Non-FastTrack Ready Partner is engaged
      - Onboarding RM  = FTCQ CSS AMERICAS or FTCQ CSS APJ or FTCQ CSS
        EMEA if partner wants assistance and DIBS is provided for at
        least one workload. 
      - Onboarding RM = FTCQ NonFRP No DIBS if the partner does not want
        assistance or would not provide DIBS for at least one workload.
  - CSS-See CSS section of the [Customer Engagement
    Process](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/ftccm/opsplaybook/EaY2AoIg1nxNlf2rhGGxoK0BcTKAQLJfZYw4GzT2mVoZzQ?rtime=O7vhlJtf1kg)
    document for tenant criteria. 
      - Onboarding RM = FTCQ CSS AMERICAS or FTCQ CSS APJ or FTCQ CSS
        EMEA if DIBS is provided for at least one workload. 
      - Onboarding SME = FTCQ SME if the workload meets the SME
        requirements. 
  - No Partners are Engaged, do not meet any criteria for CSS and meet
    all the following, the tenant can be reviewed for FRP Referral:
      - Customer does NOT need assistance with any paid Education SKUs
        (*Office 365 A3, Office 365 A5, Microsoft 365 A3 Microsoft 365
        A5, or Intune for Education*).
      - Customer wants assistance and Target Date, Intent and the
        Success Owner are received for at least one workload. Tenants
        can be referred to partners even if Business Reason for DIBS is
        not received, however it is important to get the Business Reason
        if the tenant cannot be referred and must be routed to CSS
        during the partner referral process. 
      - Customer has intent for at least one FRP eligible workload
        (Echange Online, Teams, SharePoint Online, Yammer, Office 365
        ProPlus, AADP and Intune). 
      - At least one FRP eligible workload \>=150 licenses.
      - 150-499 Seats - at least one FRP eligible workload is below 20%.
      - 500+ Seats - at least one FRP eligible workload is below the
        respective usage thresholds:
          -  10% usage for Exchange, Office ProPlus & AADP
          -  20% usage for Teams, SharePoint, Yammer, and Intune.
            Onboarding RM = FTCQ ALL FTC

These 8 options occur when you cannot gather DIBS and/or customer does
not want FTC assistance:

  - Customer Wants FTC Assistance + No DIBS: Onboarding RM = FTCQ NO
    DIBS
  - Unresponsive customer: Onboarding RM = FTCQ UNRESPONSIVE
  - Account Team declined to engage: Onboarding RM = FTCQ No DIBS
  - Customer Declined to Engage: Onboarding RM = FTCQ No DIBS
  - Customer has no intent to deploy any workload: Onboarding RM = FTCQ
    No DIBS
  - Duplicate/Invalid: Onboarding RM = FTCQ FRAUD
  - Reactive \<1000 Seats: Onboarding RM = FTCQ REACTIVE
