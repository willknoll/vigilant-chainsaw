# Prioritization

## Overview

The Prioritization process is how to use the prioritized portfolio view
to work with customers. Microsoft has many customers, and a vast amount
of customer data and insights are more likely to result in onboarding
success. The prioritized portfolio seeks to use those insights to help
FastTrack teams focus on customers where the time investment provides
the greatest impact. Please review this document along with the
[Frequently Asked Questions
document](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTOP/Prioritization%20Wizard/FAQ.docx?d=w64489d404e8a4e2998ba6b421edfe126).

## Objectives

  - Streamline FMs portfolio of customers using the FTOP Tenant
    Priority.
  - The FastTrack focus is on active, and especially, high-priority
    customers.
  - The Tenant Priority sorting in FTOP allows you to easily organize
    customers by priority,

## Approach

### Set Tenant Prioritization

Primary Role: **Automation**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Tenant prioritization is set dynamically by machine learning algorithms
based on many variables.

  - If no manual adjustments are needed, Prioritization process is
    complete. *Continue to next process*.
  - If manual adjustments are needed, go to the Determine Tenant
    Priority step.

### Determine Tenant Priority

Primary Role: **Automation**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Use the following criteria to determine whether a Tenant Priority must
be updated:

  - High Priority (Proactive or Active) - FTC CSS-Led engagement
    includes new customer scheduling activities but should, at a
    minimum, maintain a bi-weekly deployment engagement with a scheduled
    meeting cadence.
      - CSS-Assist scenario customers cannot be "High" priority
      - Customer/Partner-Led customers must be "low" priority

*Update FTOP customer records regularly.*

  - Medium Priority (Reactive or Less Active) - infrequent or irregular
    engagement cadence, customers/partners actively doing work on their
    side. Include "CSS-Assist" engagements, where the customer or
    partner needs occasional assistance or guidance.
      - Customer-Led or Partner-Led customers have to be "Low" priority

*Update FTOP only when engaged customer/partner/internal team.*

  - Low Priority (Inactive or Blocked) - discontinue engagement for Low
    Priority customers.
      - Customer-Led tenants must be "Low" priority
      - Partner-Led (non-vNext partners) tenants must be "Low" priority
      - Other tenants should have all Entitlement Statuses be Inactive.
        Inactive status includes any combinaton of the following:
          - In-Progress and at "Adoption Completed" or "Operate"
          - In-Progress, but phase is "Blocked" for \>3 months
          - Blocked with the timeframe \>3 months
          - No Intent
          - Duplicate/Invalid
      - Status Unknown/Customer Unresponsive tenants must be set to
        "Low" priority with reason *Customer Unresponsive*. See
        [entitlement status guidance](http://aka.ms/l1l2l3) for more
        details.

Note: If you have not made a significant effort to reengage unresponsive
customers, attempt to contact them before moving them to Low Priority.
*No FTOP status updates are required unless requested by internal
teams.*
