## 1247: Deploy Office 365 ProPlus

**Service(s):** OfficeProPlus  
**Task Location:** Enable \> Perform Enablement Tasks \> EDU: Enable
Classroom & SDS  
**Task Description**

The Preferred method of deployment is SCCM but **upgrading SCCM is out
of scope.** Configuration Manager scales for large environments and
provides extensive control over installation, updates, and settings. It
also has built-in features to make it easier and more efficient to
deploy and manage Office 365 ProPlus. We recommend deploying Office 365
ProPlus to ensure you always have the most up-to-date modern
productivity tools from Microsoft. When deploying with the Office Client
Management dashboard in Configuration and the integrated Office 365
Installer wizard, you can manage updates with Configuration Manager.

**Task instructions:**

Use the required data collected from the assessment phase to help the
customer build their deployment package.

1.  Assign end user licenses using Office 365 user administration portal
    or PowerShell. [PowerShell
    guidance.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/powershell/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-office-365-powershell)
2.  Assist the customer in building the OPP Deployment package either
    locally or by cloud distribution
      - SCCM Package using the deployment wizard to guide the creation
        of this package at <https://aka.ms/ProPlus/DeployWizard>. Share
        this URL to the customer to create the package in their
        environment. Guide the customer using the wizard to enter
        specific information about their environment. They will then set
        the basic parameters like deployment channel and architecture.
        Have the customer generate the resulting PowerShell wizard for
        the OPP package and ADR creation and have them copy to one of
        their SCCM servers. Have their admin run that script on their
        SCCM PowerShell console and verify the result. The script will
        create the package that contains the settings they've defined in
        the wizard. Refer to the steps in the wizard for step-by-step
        execution guidance. Refer to the [SCCM
        guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/deploy-office-365-proplus-with-system-center-configuration-manager#step-3---create-and-deploy-the-office-application-to-the-pilot-group)/
        [OPP SCCM step by step
        guide](http://aka.ms/FTOffice365ProPlusSCCMSbS) for manual
        deployment steps.
      - Local source deployment with the Office 365 Deployment tool.
        [Local source ODT
        guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/deploy-office-365-proplus-from-a-local-source)
      - Deploy from the cloud with the Office Deployment tool [Cloud ODT
        guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/DeployOffice/deploy-office-365-proplus-from-the-cloud)
      - Self-install from the cloud Self-install Office from the cloud
3.  Test the package deployment with pilot devices.
4.  Once deployment is applied to general purpose devices or business
    essential devices- meaning broad deployment has been started-
    enablement is complete, and the task should be marked as complete.

**Task Description**

The Assessment Workshop guides the customer to discover and plan the
Office 365 ProPlus deployment, and will inform, through discussion with
the customer, the important decision points for the deployment. Delivery
of the workshop should include the IT team responsible for the Office
365 ProPlus deployment. Customers can be directed to the [Office
Deployment
Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/deployment-guide-for-office-365-proplus)
and uses a consistent structure for further supporting resources.

In the ProPlus assessment workshop use the OneDrive for Business content
to highlight how the Office 365 ProPlus experience is improved when
combined with OneDrive for Business. This includes collaboration in the
Office applications and direct access to your files using known folder
move. For customers who have this need and interest they can obtain
OneDrive for Business onboarding guidance from FastTrack. Additional
content is available from the OneDrive for Business value discussion at
<http://aka.ms/ODB_BVD>.

**Task instructions:**

Use the following steps to understand the customer plans to deploy
Office 365 ProPlus to their end users. The preferred method is SCCM as
this aligns to Win10 deployments, but other deployment methods are
supported by FTC.

FE to deliver [OPP Assessment Workshop](https://aka.ms/AA76297) with SME
support. The Assessment will help customers identify these key
decisions:

1.  Intent to deploy Office 365 ProPlus
      - Coordinate any changes in intent with the assigned FM to ensure
        the L1 status for the workload is accurate.
2.  Assess if the customer has intent and will use FastTrack to onboard
    OneDrive for Business.
      - If the customer has interest to also enable OneDrive for
        Business, inform the FM to ensure the L1 status is updated.
      - Where intent exists for OneDrive for Business inform the primary
        FE to ensure that additional workload delivery can be initiated.
3.  Assess network capability or constraints
4.  Assess application compatibility
5.  While also collecting the required data above, the FE should also
    assure they:
      - Understand and plan for Office 365 licensing activation
      - Establish the approach for deploying Office 365 ProPlus
      - Establish the approach for updating Office 365 ProPlus ([Update
        guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/overview-of-update-channels-for-office-365-proplus))
      - Identify compatibility of existing Project and Visio
        installation for install technology and versions.
        ([Compatibility
        guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/install-different-office-visio-and-project-versions-on-the-same-computer))

Key default recommendations for the ProPlus deployment are highlighted
in the assessment workshop. Ensure these recommendations are shared as
preferred path, however customers can move forward with other approaches
where they have requirements for an alternate approach.

These recommendations include:

1.  ProPlus Architecture - 64-bit
2.  Office Diagnostics Setting - Optional setting (default)
3.  Compatibility Readiness solution - Readiness Toolkit for Office,
    Readiness Dashboard where customer has Microsoft Endpoint Manager
4.  Deployment channel - Semi-Annual channel for broad deployment
5.  Build Deployment package - use the Office Customization Tool
    (<https://config.office.com>
6.  Teams in OPP - include Teams in the deployment package
7.  Package size - use Lean Install (match installed)
8.  Networking - follow networking best practices from FastTrack,
    leverage Delivery Optimization
9.  Deployment path - Leverage Configuration Manager where available
10. Managing Updates - Automatic updates from the CDN

\*Additional guidance:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/assess-office-365-proplus>

**Only use the status values listed:**

  - **Not Started:** Default - no FE action has been performed for this
    task
  - **In Progress:** FE is performing activities against the task, or
    has scheduled a discussion with the Customer
  - **Complete:** FE has completed the actions required in this task
  - **Cancelled:** FE has tried to deliver the actions required, but the
    actions were declined by the customer or they do not apply - **make

**Task Location:** Enable \> Perform Enablement Tasks \> EDU: Enable

**Task Link(s)**  
[Win10 SCCM Script Wizard](https://aka.ms/win10upgradeSCCM)  

**Task Description**

Using the guidance for step 1c in the [Get Modern Deploy and Maintain
Implementation Guidance](https://aka.ms/AA75mgw), the purpose of this is
to guide the customer through deploying Windows 10.

**Task instructions:**

For upgrading your Windows 7/8.1 devices to Windows 10, we recommend
customers utilize their existing processes to maintain consistency and
predictability. If they don’t have an existing process the recommended
path for deploying Windows 10 leverages the Windows installation program
(Setup.exe) to perform an in-place upgrade, which automatically
preserves all data, settings, applications, and drivers from the
existing operating system version. This requires the least IT effort,
because there is no need for any complex deployment infrastructure.

Leverage the Self-Service automation wizard to help your customer create
a new SCCM task sequence for Windows 7/8.1 to Windows 10 upgrade.

1.  Point your customer to this URL: <https://aka.ms/win10upgradeSCCM>
2.  Guide the customer using the wizard to enter specific information
    about their environment, such as, the location of their OS
    installation files and the location of a file share to store log
    files etc. They will then set the basic parameters like Windows
    edition and architecture and enable or disable pre-upgrade checks
    that determine if a device is ready to upgrade.
3.  Have the customer generate the resulting PowerShell wizard for the
    SCCM task sequence creation and have them copy to one of their SCCM
    servers. Have their admin run that script on their SCCM PowerShell
    console and verify the result. The script will create the Task
    sequence and OS upgrade package that contains the settings they've
    defined in the wizard.

**ANY ISSUES, ENGAGE A WIN 10 SME**

  - **Not Started:** Default - no FE action has been performed for this

[Microsoft Edge
Policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies)  

**Task Description**

The purpose of this task is to help customers with Microsoft Edge
policies prior to deploying and configuring Edge, the Edge SME should
review and/or assist the FE in configuring Edge policies.

**Task instructions:**

SME, please follow the detailed steps below to complete this task.

  - **Define and configure policies** - see [public
    guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/deploy-edge-plan-deployment#define-and-configure-policies)  
    When Enterprise Site List is ready, we recommend identifying and
    configuring the policies that the customer intends to deploy with
    Microsoft Edge. First, consider the first-run experience of the
    users. Customers can automatically import settings from the current
    browser, configure the policy for
    [AutoImportAtFirstRun](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-policies#autoimportatfirstrun).  
    For security policies, review the Microsoft Edge Security Baseline.
    The Security Baseline can be applied using the [recommended security
    configuration baseline
    settings](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/security-baseline-draft-for-chromium-based-microsoft-edge/ba-p/949991)
    or by using [Microsoft
    Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/protect/security-baseline-settings-edge).
    For other policies, review the policy configurations for [Microsoft
    Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies)
    and [Microsoft Edge
    Updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-update-policies).
  - **Define and configure policies** - see [public
    guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/deploy-edge-plan-deployment#define-and-configure-policies)  
    There are mainly two options: Allow Microsoft Edge to update itself
    (default), or have explicit control over when updates are deployed
    (IT managed updates). For the last option, the customer an disable
    automatic updates and deploy Edge version using their tool of choice
    (see the [Update Policy
    reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/microsoft-edge-update-policies)),
    including
      - [Microsoft Intune for
        Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/apps/apps-windows-edge?toc=https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/toc.json&bc=https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/breadcrumb/toc.json)
      - [Configuration
        Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployEdge/deploy-edge-with-configuration-manager)
      - Or another management tool, download and deploy the [MSI file
        for Microsoft Edge](https://aka.ms/EdgeEnterprise)

## 4099: Verify if AAD Security Defaults are Enabled on Tenant Prior to Migration

**Service(s):** SharePoint / OneDrive / Exchange  
**Task Location:** Assess \> Migration Assessment \> Provide migration
questionnaire to customer  

**Task Link(s)**  
[How to check for security defaults in AAD
UI](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2114497&clcid=0x409)  

**Task Description**

The purpose of this task is check if your customer will require a
special Migration process. One main issue is that FastTrack supported
migrations require running scripts with elevated accounts that do not
support MFA – this task checks if the security defaults are set on the
tenant that would generate MFA for this account type.

**Task Instructions**

1.  For all O365 customers, non-EMS and/or AAD Premium licensed tenants,
    ask the customer if security defaults are set- provide steps on how
    to find this setting.
2.  If the customer is planning a migration in FastTrack, and they have
    security defaults set, you will need to request AADP P2 trial
    licenses and assign an FE to help guide the customer on the AADP
    configuration required to allow migration.
      - Optionally present the migration process slide deck to customer.

[Requesting and Applying AADP P2 License
Instructions](https://aka.ms/AA75tio)  

**Task Description**

These licenses are needed for any O365 customer tenants who have AAD
security defaults set and are requesting migration support. Applying
these licenses will allow an FE to configure the necessary policies to
prepare for migration steps. You will need to determine how many
licenses to request, and understand how to guide the customer on how to
apply them to their respective tenant’s.

**Task Instructions:**

Review the AAD P2 Trial License Request Instructions. Once AAD P2 trial
licenses are assigned on the tenant, coordinate with your FE to then
guide the customer with applying CA policies to prepare for additional
migration workflows.

Instructions](https://aka.ms/AA7628r)  

**Task Description**

For Office customers wanting FastTrack support for migrations, and who
have security defaults set on their tenant, follow the documented steps
to allow turning off security defaults while maintaining the same
security via CA policies. When complete, migration workflows should be
able to execute as expected.

**Task Instructions:**

  - Verify AAD P2 trial licenses are assigned on the tenant with the FM
  - FE to review with customer: instructions on CA policy configuration
    required to establish exact security defaults settings
  - Verify customer tenant configuration

[Shifting CA Policies to Security Defaults](https://aka.ms/AA76292)  

**Task Description**

For Office customers who completed migrations and used trial AAD P2
licenses and are ready to re-enable security defaults. If the trial
license period end date is reached, it will affect your customer’s AAD
configuration. Your customer can always purchase AADP P2 licenses, but
in this scenario has decided to remove their trial and setup their
tenant to the prior state using security defaults.

**Task Instructions:**

  - Verify AAD P2 trial licenses are still assigned on the tenant with
    the FM/MVM
  - FE review instructions on AAD configuration required to switch back
    to security defaults
  - Verify customer tenant configuration is using security defaults
