# Request for Assistance (RFA) Motion

The Request for Assistance (RFA) motion will deliver the FastTrack
Benefit to all eligible customers who request assistance from FastTrack
via the Request for Assistance form on the FastTrack Portal.

### Scope

RFA’s can be opened by the Microsoft Account team, a partner on behalf
of the customer, or directly by the customer. Upon submission of an RFA,
the Gateway team will assign it to the proper delivery resource based on
the customer classification and workloads designated in the request.

RFA submissions by customers of the Top 1500 Customer Health list, the
Windows 10 priority list and Get Modern targeted list will be routed to
the FastTrack Center, which will deliver the respective playbook /
motion accordingly by the Customer Health Team.

Customers not in the above lists will be routed through the
FastTrack-Ready Partner (FRP) routing rules and assign to FRP’s when possible.

## Objectives

The RFA motion goal is to refer 75% of the customers to FastTrack Ready Partners. The remaining customers will be assigned to FastTrack Center (FTC) where the FastTrack benefit will be delivered until enablement is complete. The outcome of the RFA motion is to provide the FastTrack benefit to eligible customers per the service description as well as positively impact usage targets for the FastTrack Centers and Field.
