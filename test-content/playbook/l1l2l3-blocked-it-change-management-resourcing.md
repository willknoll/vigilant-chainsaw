# IT Change Management and Resourcing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Definition:** Service maintenance or updates are causing existing Customer IT processes and policies (e.g., IT process, monitoring, incident handling, issue discovery, home use policy, etc.) to break, blocking adoption. Requires process or policy redesign to manage the change. Customer may be blocked by lack of resourcing (budget/people) to remediate. For this L2, the problem must be related to the Technical Administrators or IT Teams. It is NOT directly related to the underlying technology, user readiness, or business rules.

## Valid Example Scenarios:
| Valid Example Scenario | Scenario Status |
| :--: | :--: |
| Customer needs to change and document testing process to adjust for more frequent updates. | IT Change Management and Resourcing |
| IT has discovered it does not have the skills to manage a workload that has been enabled. | IT Change Management and Resourcing |
| IT training staff does not feel they can adapt to frequent feature updates in the cloud. | IT Change Management and Resourcing |
| Customer unsure how to implement business policies that would accommodate moving to the cloud. | IT Change Management and Resourcing |
| Customer does not have the ability to manage the deployment with existing staff. | IT Change Management and Resourcing |
| Customer does not have resources to train end users. | IT Change Management and Resourcing |


## Invalid Example Scenarios for this L2:
| Invalid Example Scenario | Scenario Status |
| :--: | :--: |
| Customer would need to design and implement stop gap system to get service to function as needed. | App Compatibility |
| Too busy to train users | Adoption Readiness |


> [!TIP]
> If you are still unsure about using this L2, here are some questions to ask the customer to confirm if this is the appropriate L2 to be used:
>    1. Does the IT Staff have enough people or budgetary resources?
>    2. Do the IT resources available have the proper skillset? If no – have they considered working with a partner?
>    3. Is the customer's IT staff ready to support cloud workloads? (e.g., Helpdesk)
>    4. Is there an issue with being able to manage the updates to ensure compatibility with internal software?
>    5. Is there a concern that the IP allow list will not be updated appropriately and is subject to cause a loss of service?​
