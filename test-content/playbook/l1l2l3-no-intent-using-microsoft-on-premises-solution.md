# Using Microsoft On-Premises Solution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Definition:** The customer has no intent to use the service because they are using a Microsoft on-premises solution. The case to use the Microsoft cloud service is not compelling or has not been made to the customer. Selling of economic or business value, or a better value proposition is needed.

## Valid Example Scenarios:
| Valid Example Scenario | Scenario Status |
| :--: | :--: |
| Customer does not want to use Office 365 (O365) because they are using a solution provided by Microsoft that has the same functionality (e.g., Skype for Business on premises versus Skype for Business Online.) | Using Microsoft On-Premises Solution |
| Service will not be deployed because of dependent workloads staying on-prem. | Using Microsoft On-Premises Solution |
| Service is purchased for licensing rights for on-prem deployment only. | Using Microsoft On-Premises Solution |
| Customer is unwilling to deprecate infrastructure at this time. | Using Microsoft On-Premises Solution |


## Invalid Example Scenarios for this L2:
| Invalid Example Scenario | Scenario Status |
| :--: | :--: |
| Customer will stay on-prem because of network limitations. | Customer IT Infrastructure, Remediation |
| Customer does not want to deploy cloud service because they believe ROI is better on-prem. | Executive Sponsorship |
| Customer is staying on-prem because of legal restrictions about cloud deployments. | Security/Privacy (Non-Product/Feature) |


> [!TIP]
> If you are still unsure about using this L2, here are some questions to ask the customer to confirm if this is the appropriate L2 to be used:
>    1.​ Is the reason the cloud service is not being deployed a direct result of an already deployed on-prem version, or is there a blocker somewhere else causing the customer to keep using on-prem?​
>    ​
