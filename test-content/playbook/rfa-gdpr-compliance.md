## GDPR Compliance

Microsoft and the FastTrack Center are compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations. If you have a customer who asks about GDPR:

- Tell them that Microsoft is GDPR compliant and send them to the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/privacy/gdpr-overview) to learn more about GDPR and Microsoft.

- If they want you to delete their data, tell them that the Customer Contact or their Tenant Admin must send an email to submit an Office 365 FastTrack GDPR Request to [O365FTGDPR@microsoft.com](mailto:O365FTGDPR@microsoft.com).

- Additional information can be found in CM-54288: [FTC General Data Protection Regulation Training](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/ftcinfo/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1259) or in the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDRP) Guidance for FastTrack](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ftccm/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7bE857ED81-F353-4654-8CEA-5CB410A4D00B%7d&file=General%20Data%20Protection%20Regulation.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true).
