# FE / SME Notes Guidance

[!INCLUDE [COVID Guidance](./includes/playbook-covid-guidance.md)]  

Primary Role: **FastTrack Engineer; FastTrack Engineer SME**  
Applies To: **All Services**

## Objectives

There are two types of notes which should be used by FastTrack Engineers: Technical Enablement Notes and Environment Notes.  This guidance details the expectations placed on the M365 FEs and SMEs pertaining to the frequency, note's content and format.  

## [Technical Enablement Notes](guidance-technical-enablement-notes.md)

Technical Enablement notes should be used to document workload specific technical updates. These notes should contain technical information related to the current status of the Enablement effort that is ongoing with the customer as well as details of the challenges found during this phase.  

## [Environment Notes](guidance-environment-notes.md)

Environment Notes should be used to share helpful information about the customer environment and may be specific to a service.  The purpose of this note is to reduce the need to go back to the customer for technical information related to their environment.  An FE can use this note type to share important information with another FE/SME related to customer's current technical architecture or service-related information.
