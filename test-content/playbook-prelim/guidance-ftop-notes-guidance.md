# FTOP Notes Guidance  

[!INCLUDE [COVID Guidance](./includes/playbook-covid-guidance.md)]  

Note Guidance is being communicated to ensure that we are following a consistent process across all regions. This will improve predictability and reduce confusion regarding which notes go where and how often they need to be recorded.  

## New Notes Library Related Changes  

The image below contains the updated note mapping table and identifies which roles commonly edit those note types.  

| Historical Note Type* | New Note Type | Role | Description |
| --- | --- | :----: | --- |
| Overall Status | Engagement Management | FM | Updates related to the engagement, account team relationship insights, high-level technical overview and issues impacting the ability to make progress as planned.  |
| Entitlement Status | Service Intent | FM | Customer's intent to deploy a service or lack thereof and the primary reason "why" |
| Enterprise Status | Enterprise Status (no change) - available to review in the new Notes Library | FTA/FM |  |
| Service Specific Time Entry | Technical Enablement | FE/SME | Technically focused information regarding engagement with customer |
| Task Notes | Technical Enablement | FE/SME | Context and additional detail related to Playbook tasks |
|  | **NEW!** Environment | FE/SME | Customer environment details to facilitate smooth hand off between FEs/SMEs reducing follow-up with customer for same information |

**Historical note migration plan associated with the Notes Library launch effective February 7th, 2020.**  

As part of the introduction of the new Notes Library, many of the historical note types will be migrated and renamed to the updated naming convention.  Here are a few examples to help illustrate this change.  

- An Overall status note created prior to the launch of the new Notes Library will become an Engagement Management note.  To find a historical Overall Status note, search for an Engagement Management note and determine the time it was entered.  
- Another example would be if you were looking for a historical Entitlement Status note.  That note would now be labeled as a Service Intent note. You could find it using Latest Notes or Search within the new Notes Library.  
- Similarly, if you would you like to find a Service Specific Time Entry note, it can be located by filtering or searching for a Technical Enablement note instead.  

In summary, after the cutover to the new Notes Library, you will be able to find historical notes based on the new naming convention as defined in the table above.

High-level note recording expectations on the frequency, location and content of a note by role are as follows:

- FastTrack Manager (FM) roles will continue to utilize *Engagement Management Notes* for all non-workload specific updates including high-level technical overview, customer or Account team relationship insights and details of meetings delivered or scheduled for future use. These updates will be entered when the FM feels it is appropriate (e.g., after a call with the customer or Account team). Each FM will utilize the *Engagement Management Notes* field for engagement Executive (Exec) Summary updates when requested by a Regional Manager (RM).  
- FMs and FastTrack Architects (FTA) accountable for the health of S1500 customers will utilize the Enterprise Status notes for updates in the winner tenant only. For S500, the FTA is accountable for Enterprise Status updates, but the FM is accountable for Enterprise Status updates on the S501+ customers per the  [Enterprise Status Note Guidance](guidance-enterprise-status-notes.md).  
- The FM (and certain SME teams) will continue to utilize Service Intent Notes, per the guidance in  [Service Intent Note Guidance](status-guidance-service-intent-notes.md) to provide a current description of **intent** for the entitlements in each workload. Updates should be provided as needed so that the workload entitlements have a clear and up to date description that accurately reflects workload intent.  
- The FastTrack Engineer (FE)/SME roles will now utilize the *Technical Enablement notes* to record the engagement status each time an FE/SME has an interaction with a customer, internal stakeholder, or undertakes an engagement related activity. In addition, they will be able to leverage *Environment notes* to capture relevant customer environment related details to facilitate smooth hand-offs and reduce the number of follow-ups for similar information with the customer.   .  

The following notes types have been deprecated. Therefore, it is suggested that teams using these notes instead adopt the note types in this guidance.  

- Customer Sat Notes
- Service Status Notes
- Technical Notes
