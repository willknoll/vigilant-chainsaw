# Send Engagement Scenario Escalation  

## Type and use of document

- Topic category: Request for Assistance (RFA)
- Primary role: Gateway RFA and Referral FMs
- Use: Guidance for submitting an Engagement Scenario Change Request ticket

## Summary

This article provides step-by-step guidance for Gateway RFA Team FMs to follow when submitting an Engagement Scenario Change Request ticket as part of the process found in the [RFA Process Guide](rfa-process-guide.md), the [Windows 10 and Edge RFA Process Guide](rfa-windows-10-and-edge-process-guide.md), and the [FRP Referral Guide](frp-referral-guide.md). The FM will employ this conditional step if the Engagement Scenario needs to be changed *from* an FTP-led, CSS-led, or CXP-led Engagement Scenario selection.

## Approach

1. To file a request to change the Engagement Scenario from FTC-CSS Led, FTC-FTP Led, or FTC-CXP Led, to another Engagement Scenario selection, open a new ticket in [**FTC Help**](https://o365cxp.microsoftcrmportals.com/FTCChangeRequest/).

1. Select Create FTC Request.

1. Complete the Request form with the following information:

    - **Case Title:** URGENT: RFA Engagement Scenario Change

    - **Customer Name:** [Customer Name]

    - **TPID (if available):** [TPID]

    - **Customer Domain:** [tenant domain]

    - **Region:** [Customer Region]

    - **Country:** [Customer Country]

    - **Tenant Team Manager (TM):** [Assigned RM]

      - **Americas** – Jeff Garrett

      - **EMEA** – Valentin Craioveanu

      - **APJ** – Girish Rajan

    - **Tenant ID:** [Tenant ID]

    - **Task ID** will remain blank

    - **FTC Help Category:** Engagement Scenario Change

    - **FTC Help Subcategory:** [desired Engagement Scenario]

    - **Details:** [reason for tenant reassignment and the stakeholder who approved the reassignment (such as the FPM)]

    - **Workloads:** [workloads relevant to the reassignment]

1. An automated response will be sent from O365 CXP escalation. Add the Tenant Team Manager (TM) from above to the reply and respond with the following information: “***This is an RFA (COVID 19) tenant that meets the assignment business rules for an FRP referral. Can I get approval to change to FRP led? See answers in line below***.”

    - Is this a S400 customer (yes/no): No

    - Is this customer "Active" (yes/no): No, not since *Date*

    - Did the customer request FTC or removal of FRP (yes/no): No, this is an RFA

      - If yes please provide evidence (emails, etc.)

    - Did FTC gather DIBS from customer (yes/no): No, this is an RFA

      - If yes please provide evidence (emails, etc.)
