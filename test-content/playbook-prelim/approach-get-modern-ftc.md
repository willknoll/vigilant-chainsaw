# FastTrack Center Scale Approach  

Program Manager: **Dan Rowley**

## Overview

The FY20 Get Modern motion is designed for FastTrack Engineers, with support from FastTrack Managers & Get Modern Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), to guide qualified customers through the Windows 7/8.1 to Windows 10 upgrade process as well as deploying Office 365 ProPlus using System Center.  

For customers who are interested or have requested assistance staying current with Windows 10 and Office 365 ProPlus, our Get Modern Subject Matter Experts are available to assist with the optional steps in this motion.

For customers who need assistance to migrate data to OneDrive for Business can obtain guidance to setup and leverage OneDrive for Business ahead of the Window 10 upgrade. 

For deployment of Office 365 ProPlus without Windows upgrade, please reference the [Office 365 ProPlus Standalone Scale Playbook](https://aka.ms/ftoppplaybook). 


## Objectives

The following is a list of objectives for this approach:
- **Keeping our customers secure and helping them to shift to Windows 10** is imperative.
- As we help customers get modern with Microsoft 365, securing endpoints with Windows 10 is also of strategic importance to Microsoft in a competitive landscape.
- **Ensuring customers deploy and use the latest cloud connected Office client applications** in organizations is critical as we continue to support our customers as they prepare for Office 2010 end of **support and through their digital transformation journey.**
- **Office 365 ProPlus is of strategic importance to Microsoft** among competition as we shift our customers to the cloud with Microsoft 365.


## Approach
Primary Roles: **FastTrack Manager; FastTrack Engineer; SME**  
Applies To: **Windows 10 & Office 365 ProPlus**

If an engaged FE is confident in their understanding, capabilities to deliver the Get Modern motion the FE should be empowered to continue with the engagement. However, if the engagement becomes stalled, blocked, or the FE requires any additional support executing this playbook, the FE shall request a Get Modern SME (OPP and/or Windows SME) using the FastTrack Resource Request Tool.

The Get Modern SME team is a dedicated team of Windows and OPP SMEs that is available to support at scale motion. The SMEs are adjunct resources to the capabilities of the FastTrack delivery, but at no time do they replace the roles of the FastTrack Manager, Engineer or Architect.
