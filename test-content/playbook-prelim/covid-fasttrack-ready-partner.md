# FastTrack Ready Partner  

## Tools and Incentives  

We have enabled FastTrack Ready Partners (FRPs) to deliver the FastTrack Benefit as Microsoft addresses COVID-19. A registration tool specifically for trial SKUs to support #covid customers has been made available to partners via the FTOP Portal. (For new customers, using normal paid SKUs partners will register them through CPOR.) Partners have also had incentives associated with usage realization. It is important for us to track the impact of COVID-19 on our demand and capacity. We also want to understand shifting customer priorities on workload deployment and adoption.


## FRP Documentation  

For customers that request M365 deployment assistance or shifted deployment/adoption priorities due to COVID-19 (e.g., Teams), we're asking that the **#covid** hashtag be added to the **Engagement Management** and/or **Service Intent** notes fields along with additional details of how COVID-19 has changed the customer's priorities. For general guidance on using **FTOP Notes**, [click here](https://partner-docs.microsoft.com/partner-site/fasttrack-playbook/english-playbook/guidance-ftop-notes-guidance-partner.html).  

## COVID-19 Registration  

The [FRPCovidRegistration](https://aka.ms/FRPCovidRegistration) tool enables partners to directly record new customers using the special trial SKUs associated with #covid. It also assists the FRP team in tracking these new customers and forecasting incentives.

## COVID-19 On-boarding Incentives  

On-boarding incentives are available to FRP Partners when they assist with on-boarding E1/G1/A5 trial SKU's. A Student Enablement fee, equivalent to the value of the Teams incentive for eligible tenants, has been added.
