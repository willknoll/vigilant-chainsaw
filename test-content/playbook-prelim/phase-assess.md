# Assess Phase

The Assess Phase identifies how the FastTrack team conducts a Technical
Assessment to gain an understanding of the customer’s infrastructure to document
it. In the Services Workshop, FastTrack discusses the customer’s goals for each
workload to help them understand how workloads can benefit their organization. An Adoption & Change Management Customer Conversation introduces the importance of planning and measuring success including defining Success Factors and planning activities.

The processes within this phase include:
-   [Conduct Technical Assessment](assess-conduct-technical-assessment.md)
-   [Conduct Security and Compliance Workshops](assess-conduct-security-and-compliance-workshops.md)
-   [Conduct Services Workshops](assess-conduct-services-workshops.md)
-   [Conduct Adoption & Change Management Customer Conversation](assess-conduct-adoption-and-change-management-conversation.md)
