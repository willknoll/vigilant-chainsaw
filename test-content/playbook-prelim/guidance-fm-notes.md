# FM Notes Guidance

[!INCLUDE [COVID Guidance](./includes/playbook-covid-guidance.md)]  

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Applies To: **All Services**

## Objectives  

There are three types of notes which should be used by the FM roles: Engagement Management Notes, Enterprise Status Notes, and Service Intent Notes. This guidance details the expectations placed on the FMs (and certain SME teams) pertaining to the frequency, the location, and the note's content and format.

## [Engagement Management Notes](guidance-fm-engagement-management-notes.md)  

Engagement Management Notes should be used for all non-workload specific  updates including high-level technical overview, account team relationship insights and meeting/workshops delivered or scheduled, as well as project management or resource issues impacting the ability of the customer to make progress as planned. They should include detail on the Next Action, Date, and Owner of the next action. [Engagement Management Notes](guidance-fm-engagement-management-notes.md) can  also be used for more formal Exec Summary updates on engagements. These updates provide the FastTrack Leadership Team (LT) and RM with a snapshot of current key information relating to the customer.

## [Enterprise Status Notes](guidance-enterprise-status-notes.md)  

FM roles supporting S501+ customers should use Enterprise Status Notes in the winner tenant to provide an overall Health view of the customer per the guidance in the [Enterprise Status Notes Guidance](guidance-enterprise-status-notes.md). For further information on Customer Health, visit the [Situational Awareness Resources](https://fasttrack-docs.microsoft.com/role-guide/fta-situational-awareness-resources.html).

## [Service Intent Notes](status-guidance-service-intent-notes.md)  

Service Intent Notes should be used by each FM (and certain SME teams) to provide a current picture of the entitlements in each workload, per the guidance in the [Service Intent Notes Guidance](status-guidance-service-intent-notes.md). Updates should be provided when there is a change in the L1 status that needs the associated note for additional context and clarification.
