# Conduct Services Workshop

Phase: **Assess**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Conduct Services Workshop process is an in-depth workshop to expand
the customer's technical knowledge of each individual service. The
FastTrack Specialist-led workshops expand on how the service works, how
onboarding occurs, and provide public content the customer uses as a
reference. When complete, customers gain a firm technical understanding
of services they are onboarding and the process to achieve that.

## Objectives

  - Provide more clarity about service(s):
      - Demonstrate how the service operates
      - Show key features that support the customer organization
  - Leverage velocity:
      - Assist with migration preparation

Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

**COVID Guidance**  

The FastTrack Covid-19 response makes recommendations to quickly enable remote work for our customers. The guidance quickly enables Teams with recommended security in place.  

Detailed COVID guidance has been added to applicable workload steps and tasks.  

Continue tracking COVID-19 response for [accelerating](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/ftcinfo/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1881) and [decelerating](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/ftcinfo/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1888) workloads.  

**Ensure the customer is ready**  

**Pre-requisites – browsers**  
Users will need an **up-to-date browser** to access the Office on the web capabilities. Refer to this [support article](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/which-browsers-work-with-office-for-the-web-ad1303e0-a318-47aa-b409-d3a5eb44e452) for a list of supported browsers across PC, Mac, iOS, and Android platforms.  

**Foundation – Tenant**  

- Does the customer already have an Office 365 tenant with the required licenses?  
  - Customers should already have a tenant, however, if your customer is not licensed for Teams, use the [new Office 365 E1/G1 offer](https://transform.microsoft.com/customer-trials?tab=o365e1trial) or [Education A1](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/MicrosoftTeamsCOVID-19Response/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b36EEBE2A-A96D-4CB0-9DA4-4A5465176D3D%7d&file=Microsoft%20Teams%20Trial%20Options.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) offer to get them started. Coordinate this request with your account team contacts.  
  - As part of Microsoft’s COVID response, if the business is not currently licensed for Office 365, they are covered with a free Office 365 E1 offer for six months.  

**Share user readiness resources**  
Share the following resources to educate the customers and their end users on our services and aligned business scenarios.

**Commercial**   

- [Adopt Microsoft Teams Landing Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/adopt-microsoft-teams-landing-page)  
- [Teams Training Landing Page for (Admins, Instructor-Led, End User)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/training-microsoft-teams-landing-page)  
- [Office 365 Training Center](https://support.office.com/office-training-center)  

**Education:**  

- [Helping Teachers and Students make the switch to remote learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/11/helping-teachers-students-switch-remote-learning/)  
- [Microsoft Teams guide for EDU IT Admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/expand-teams-across-your-org/teams-for-education-landing-page)  

In all cases, ensure they are aware of the Office 365 Training center. Here they'll find courses on how to [work together](https://support.office.com/article/best-practices-for-collaborating-with-office-365-5144136b-1ff8-476f-bcba-00de0bdaa600) and use the [Office for the web](https://support.office.com/article/office-for-the-web-training-e315b031-2bd5-40a1-99ca-264ebf2c8f96) solutions and many others.  

Admins can also leverage the admin center communication templates for the easiest way to share the recommended guidance. Further resources to help them share resources, like tips and tricks, are available in the [FastTrack Resource Hub](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack/resources).  

Remote work tips: Share the [remote-work tips](https://aka.ms/Remote-Work_Tips_FT) for customers to distribute to their users to help them sustain productivity during this change.

### Conduct Specific Get Modern Workshops

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

The FY20 Get Modern motion is designed for FastTrack Managers & Engineers, with support from Get Modern Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Get Modern FastTrack Architects (GM FTAs), to guide qualified customers through the Windows 7/8.1 to Windows 10* upgrade process, as well as deploying Office 365 ProPlus using System Center, and deploying Microsoft Edge, while promoting Cloud Management in partnership with the EMS team.  

- For customers who need assistance to migrate data to OneDrive for Business, guidance can be obtained to setup and leverage OneDrive for Business ahead of the Windows 10 upgrade.  
- For deployment of Office 365 ProPlus without Windows upgrade, please reference the tasks in the Office ProPlus workload in FTOP.  
- For Edge deployments, please reference tasks in the Edge workload playbook in FTOP. If your customer is still on Windows 7/8.1, please execute the Windows 10 playbook prior to deploying Edge.  

If an engaged FE is confident in their understanding and capabilities to deliver the Get Modern motion, the FE should be empowered to continue with the engagement. However, if the engagement becomes stalled, blocked or the FE requires any additional support executing this playbook, the FE shall request a Get Modern SME (OPP and/or Windows SME) using the FastTrack Resource Request Tool.  

The Get Modern SME team is a dedicated team of Windows and OPP SMEs that is available to support at-scale motion. The SMEs are adjunct resources to the capabilities of the FastTrack delivery, but at no time do they replace the roles of the FastTrack Manager, Engineer or Architect.  

The following is a list of objectives for this approach:  

- **Keeping our customers secure and helping them to shift to Windows 10** is imperative.  
- As we help customers get modern with Microsoft 365, securing endpoints with Windows 10 is also of strategic importance to Microsoft in a competitive landscape.
