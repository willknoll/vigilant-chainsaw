# Engage Customer and Document Intent

## Overview

The Engagement Customer and Document Intent process helps you to
understand a customer's intent to deploy to align FastTrack support and
successfully deliver an end-to-end experience. The Engage Customer part
of the process identifies which workloads the customer intends to deploy
by capturing standard metrics such as the target go-live Date for
production, Intent, Business Reason and Success owner (DIBS). Refer to
Guidance: [Adoption 4+4 Pre-reqs ans Success
