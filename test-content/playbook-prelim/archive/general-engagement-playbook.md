# FastTrack General Engagement Playbook

## Overview

The FastTrack General Engagement Playbook is a collection of actions to take throughout the lifecycle of a customer engagement for all workloads to ensure a consistent experience for the customer

## Approach

### Counduct Custom Kickoff

### Prepare for Kickoff Meeting

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

FM asks questions specific to the customer's concerns/needs to achieve
overall meeting objectives to fully:

- Understand the customer's context and background, licenses owned and activity to date from FTOP.  
- Complete required handover between Gateway/Re-engagement Team (GRT) and Delivery FM before reaching out to the customer. 
- Conduct background research on the customer, leverage resources such as LinkedIn and the customer's website to gain a general understanding of the customer's industry and core business(). Leverage the Account Team where account is managed.  
- If the engagement originates through a Requests for Assistance (RFA),  
  - Set the right expectations around the FastTrack​ Benefit and completion of a workload or service.  
  - FM will disengage from the engagement once it is complete.  
    - Disengagement occurs upon completion of enablement or migration if required.  
      - Definition of enablement completion - Meets milestone of 100 Active Users or 10% for less than 1,000 seats customers.  
      - Definition of when migration is complete - Migration is complete when we have migrated a predetermined number of users as per the FastTrack Benefit Services Description.  
    - Disengagement process is complete when:  
      - FM conducts an engagement completion discussion with the customer.  
      - Task "Disengagement process is complete" is marked complete.  

If the account is managed:  

- Engage with the Account Team to understand the customer's business, latest activities, overall strategy with Microsoft 365, blockers, issues, and any other account factors to consider.
- Clarify the Account Teams' objectives for the customer account for the current Financial Year.
- Clarify the customer's organizational structure and project team member roles.
- At a minimum, notify the Account Team that you are going to schedule a kickoff call with​ the customer and invite relevant account team person to the call.

### Schedule and Conduct Kickoff Meeting

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **RFA / Targeting / Customer Health**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Schedule and conduct kickoff meeting: use [Kickoff
Deck](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTOP/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=/teams/ftccm/FTOP/Localized/Kickoff%20Deck&FolderCTID=0x012000904F5E794E882F4D94FA3B0142FA461C&View=%7b1FF97C09-983E-40DE-BF97-D16BEFEB043E%7d)
to leverage leading questions and key value points on the slides to
start conversations. Capture and track any customer knowledge gaps
during discussion to offer follow-up meetings/workshops with subject
matter experts (SME) to address. 

In this kickoff, should you see project risks such as blockers, out of
scope items, customer task constraints, etc. this is a good time to
discuss the possibility of a FastTrack Ready Partner to compliment the
FastTrack benefit.  If the customer would like to use a partner, execute
task 983 to send a referral to a partner.  You can find content on
Quickleads [here](https://aka.ms/AA5ctuy), and to enable the request you
can find the email [here](https://aka.ms/AA6cav5).   

Examples:  

 - ​Overall project management​  
 - Complex solution designing and customizations  
 - Out of FastTrack scope
 - Adoption and change management needs

available to the customer, roles and responsibilities of the FastTrack
team/ customer and(or) partner Discuss and agree on who will schedule

Motions: **Customer Health**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Meet the customer key stakeholders, such as the CIO and their Program
and Project Management team, as well as any partners involved in the
customer program, and give them a presentation on the FastTrack
Enterprise Benefit available to the customer. Convey the key messages
(see section “Key Messages” above) to set the scene and then dive deeper
to specific topics based on what the customer and partner have in scope
of their program. Ensure everybody understand the FastTrack delivery
model as well as the roles and responsibilities of every party involved.
When having the conversation with the customer, also take a note of
their DIBS and SSAT status.

  

  - Due Date, Intent, Business Reason and Sponsor (DIBS) are
    prerequisites to customer success. If any of these are not there, it
    poses a risk to the customer success going forward. Work with the
    customer to get DIBS in place, to mitigate the risk.
  - Stakeholders, Scenarios, Awareness and Training (SSAT) are enablers
    for the customer success, which usually need to be built during the
    engagement. Getting SSAT in place should be included in the plan and
    progress tracked in the Health Review meetings. If this is in
    pre-sales phase or just after the customer has purchased the
    subscription, also capture the customer’s desired engagement start
    date. This should be the date when the customer would like to start
    working with the FastTrack team.

### Request an ACM Partner

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

During the Adoption & Change Management Conversation, the customer might
state that they don’t have the skills or bandwidth to drive end user
adoption in their organization. As a FastTrack Manager, you can request
an ACM Partner for your customer through the QuickLeads partner referral
request process. Partner referrals are "For Fee" services.

Partners have deep experience with Adoption and Change Management, and
they can provide valuable services from advisory, coaching, training, to
staff augmentation to ensure project success. Note that not all Partners
offer each of these services.  

  - Partners have depth of experience with Change Management, including
    business consultants certified in Change methodology with proven
    success at increasing end user adoption.
  - Partners have breadth of service offering from advisory, consulting,
    and execution support that can be tailored to your unique needs.
  - Partners can provide in-person training and excitement days
    activities.
  - Partners can provide digital scale training platforms and
    gamification engagement models.
  - Partners can support staff augmentation where you don’t have skill
    set and/or bandwidth.

Customers can work with a partner for support for the following stages
of the Change Management journey:

  - Advisory & Planning - Discovery & Assessment and Strategy Design.
  - Training & Advisory – Execution Support and Ongoing Support.

Use the [ACM Partner Deck (Internal Only)](https://aka.ms/AA63lt6) to
learn how to position an ACM Partner with your customer. When
presenting to customers, use the [ACM Partner Deck (Customer
Ready)​](https://fasttrack-docs.microsoft.com/collateral/M365-content.html)
deck.  

If your customer is interested in engaging a Partner to support their
Adoption and Change Management needs:

- Ask your customer if it’s possible that one of their current Partners
offers the ACM services they are looking for.  
  - This is an ideal scenario where possible, and many partners can
    provide these consulting services, or make recommendations for P2P
    partnerships for these services which ensure stronger alignment
    between the partners supporting a customer.  
- If not, your Account Team can help find one that aligns to your customer
needs.  
  - If there is an Account Team, contact the account team for their
    support in determining the right local ACM partner to match the
    customer’s needs.  The Account team will review the Co-Sell ACM list
    to find ACM partners in their geography and can work with the
    customer to make contact with the Partner Customer Success Manager
    contact. Account Teams should provide multiple partners for
    customers to choose from.
- If no Account Team, follow the FastTrack QuickLeads Task 983 process or
you can learn more about QuickLeads in [FTC - Partner Collaboration
Opportunity](https://aka.ms/AA5ctuy), and to enable the request you can
use the [FastTrack Partner Referral
Request](https://aka.ms/AA6cav5) email
template.  
  - When submitting a Partner Referral Request, you will need to
    identify what type of service the customer needs (i.e. Advisory and Planning, Training and Enablement, or both).
  - You will need to obtain customer verbal approval to share PII data
    (contact information) with the partners we will refer.
  - 3 partners will be selected for the customer to choose from.
    Partners will be matched by location and specialty needed. Customers
    will receive email notification when referrals are made.
  - ​Partners will contact the customer directly within 3 business days
    after referrals are made.
