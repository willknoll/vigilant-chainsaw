# Reactive Model

Microsoft provides various automated bots and wizards to help a customer onboard to the services in addition to extensive [self-service guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/deploy-microsoft-365-enterprise). If a customer encounters a problem or needs additional help with these tools, they can request help from Microsoft through [Automated Onboarding Assistance](multiple-phases-automated-onboarding-assistance.md).

In addition, if a customer meets [minimum FastTrack eligibility requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/m365-eligible-services-and-plans), they can request FastTrack onboarding assistance. The FastTrack Center will process these [Requests for Assistance (RFA)](monitor-request-for-assistance.md) and determine the proper engagement motion, if applicable.
