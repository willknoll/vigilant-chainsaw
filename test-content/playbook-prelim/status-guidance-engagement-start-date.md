# Engagement Start Date Details
The Engagement Start Date field has been added to the FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP) and must be populated with data going forward. This site will assist users to understand the impact, how to use the field, and provide frequently asked questions (FAQ) surrounding the field. 

## Definition
The Engagement Start Date is the date the customer requests to start participating in initial FastTrack (FTC) onboarding discussions and/or kickoff with the assigned FastTrack Manager (FM) for this specific workload. 

The information being captured is the exact date the customer expects to engage with FTC delivery for onboarding assistance. The Engagement Start Date does not mean it is the start of any communication with the FTC, such as FastTrack Architect (FTA) or Gateway interactions. Instead, it is the start of delivery onboarding activities. The typical way to capture this information would be to ask, "When will you be ready to engage with our FM to initiate the FastTrack process?".

## Reason for Change
Currently in the FTC process and FTOP, we do not have a way to capture when a customer makes a request or is ready to engage with the FM to initiate their deployment experience. What is captured currently is the project Target Date as defined by Due date Intent Business reason Success owners (DIBS). The Target Date is a future date, past the Engagement Start Date where the customer wants to complete the onboarding of a set of users past technical enablement.  

This change creates is an Engagement Start Date field element per workload to capture the initial date when the FTC engagement is initiated. Effective with this FTOP user interface (UI) release, there is a new data element called the Engagement Start Date, which displays in the FTOP Services Task for every workload.  

## Impact and Usage
The process for tracking a customer's Engagement Start Date will impact several of the teams within the FTC, as outlined below. In general, any time DIBS are collected, the Engagement Start Date should also be collected.  
- FTA: During the pre-sales discovery workshop or landing the benefit workshop, the FTA will collect DIBS and the Engagement Start Date for every workload.  
- Gateway Team: For new customers or customer engagements being processed, in addition to DIBS, the Gateway Team will collect the Engagement Start Date for every workload.  
- Re-Engagement Team: For customer engagements being processed, in addition to DIBS, the Re-Engagement Team will collect the Engagement Start Date for every workload.  
- Delivery Teams: For any current customer where there is a sequential deployment motion of workloads, or Intent is obtained for new workloads, the FM or FastTrack Engineer (FE) is asked to collect and enter the Engagement Start Date for that workload, as per the questions and definitions above.
