## Overview
The Assessment takes the form of an interview with key members of the account team and other internal Microsoft teams engaged with the customer.

## Objectives
Evaluate our set of customers with regards to their intent to deploy Teams and intent transition from Skype for Business Online to Teams and any blockers they may be facing.

  - Prioritize customer engagement to build our pipeline 
  - Assess customer transition readiness based on intent and blockers 
  - Document known blockers or areas of resistance 
  - Define clear next steps
