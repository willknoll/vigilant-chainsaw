# Engagement Phase

The Engagement Phase identifies how the FastTrack team identifies which
workloads the customer plans to use by documenting standard metrics like target
date to start **D**eployment, **I**ntent, **B**usiness reason and **S**uccess
(DIBS) owner. Afterwards, the FastTrack team determines a customer’s intent to
deploy purchased services and aligns the appropriate FastTrack support to
successfully deliver an end-to-end experience for the customer.

The Engagement Phase is utilized by the [Targeting Motion](motion-targeted.md).
