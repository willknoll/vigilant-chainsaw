# Frequently Asked Questions

## Scenario

Our assignment teams cannot find any documentation on how to change a status of a SME request after it is completed.  We need this ability.  There are situations where a request may be originally rejected, but then an issue resolved, and assignment could continue instead of a new request being submitted.

## Response

Once the request is completed, thereâ€™s an internal flow that is Resolving the Case. In this scenario, the form will show as Read-Only and will not allow the user to continue working.

In order to continue with this case, select **Reactivate Case** in the upper menu and confirm in the pop-up. This will allow the user to continue with the approval process.
