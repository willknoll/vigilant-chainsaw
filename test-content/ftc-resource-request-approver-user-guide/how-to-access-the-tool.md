# How to Access the Tool

To request CRM Access, the user should:

1. Visit [Dynamics Business Platform](https://dynamicsatmsft.microsoftcrmportals.com). Right-click to open link in new tab.

1. Select **Manage Application** -> **User Provisioning** -> **Users**

1. Complete the Request CRM Access form:

    a. Under **Business Justification**, you can write **Validation**

    b. Under **Data Protection Acceptance**, review the notice and select **Yes** if you agree

    c. Under **Application Name**, search on and select **FastTrack365**  

    d. Under **Business Unit**, click search and it should pre-populate with the value **FastTrack365**

    e. Under **Role**, the only option to select is **Salesperson**

1. Select **Submit**.

You will receive email from Dynamics notifying you when your request is approved and complete.

>[!NOTE]
>If you are not on our “known approvers list”, we will check with your manager and ask him or her to add you to the proper email distribution list(s) that currently receives notifications from the Resource Request Tool before we can approve the request to add you in Dynamics.

If you are unable to get to step #3, verify you are logged in and try at least twice. If unsuccessful, raise a ticket with MSIT at [dynatms](dynatms@microsoft.com).
