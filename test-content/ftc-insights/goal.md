- **FTC Migration (Guidance, Tools, Migration docs, asks):** <br>Related to the ***FastTrack Migration*** benefit guidance, collateral, tooling (Exchange Online and OneDrive migration)
- **FTC Process, Documentation or delivery collateral:** <br>Feedback about ***how*** we can expedite engagements by augmenting the FTC guidance and supporting workload collateral
