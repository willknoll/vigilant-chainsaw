# Discuss Device Threat Protection

Purpose is to discuss:

As criminals become more sophisticated with their attacks, Microsoft is here to help. Protecting your device is critical to malware and other threats.

- Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (MDATP) is a platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced
    threats.

- MDATP requires one of the following Microsoft Volume Licensing offers:

    - Windows 10 Enterprise E5

    - Windows 10 Education A5

    - Microsoft 365 E5 (M365 E5) which includes Windows 10 Enterprise E5

    - Microsoft 365 E5 Security

    - Microsoft 365 A5 (M365 A5)

-   MDATP protects endpoints from cyber threats, detects advanced attacks and
    data breaches, automates security incidents, and improves security posture
    with the following suite of capabilities

    - [Threat & Vulnerability Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/#tvm)

    - [Attack surface reduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/#asr)

    - [Next generation protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/#ngp)

-   Deployment methods for MDATP include

    - [GPO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/configure-endpoints-gp#onboard-machines-using-group-policy)

    - [Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/protect/advanced-threat-protection)

- If you do not have the necessary licenses for MDATP, ensure antivirus is turned on for device
