# Discuss Device Management

​Purpose is to discuss:

- How implementing a device management strategy is an important requirement for establishing a security baseline.

- How complex device landscape (Windows, iOS, Mac, & Android) presents an array of challenges to keep data secure on corporate owned and employee-owned (BYOD) devices.

- Help customers to choose:

    - to use device management (with device enrollment)

    - to use application management (without device enrollment)

    - to use a combination of the two

For organizations using Configuration Manager to manage Windows 10 devices, Cloud-attaching Configuration Manger with Intune will help them unlock additional cloud value.

Key value: *Intune will enable employee productivity while keeping the devices, data stored on those devices, and application behavior secure*.

If your customer has intent to deploy Intune MDM, Intune app protection, or to Cloud Attach Configuration Manager with Intune, request an EMS SME, see [FastTrack Center Resource Request](https://aka.ms/ftcresourcerequest) to drive the engagement.
