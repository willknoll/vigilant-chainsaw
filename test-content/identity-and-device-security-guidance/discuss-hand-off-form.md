# Discuss Hand Off Form

Once delivered, if the customer has additional interest in EMS features, the FE completes the [“Hand Off form”](https://aka.ms/idshandoff) in FTOP task 3721 and shares it with the assigned EMS FE. Request an EMS SME if you don’t already have a person assigned to your customer, see [FastTrack Center Resource Request](https://aka.ms/ftcresourcerequest).
