# Latest Notes

## Overview

This page provides two separate functions depending on the context of where you access Latest Notes.

- If you access Latest Notes directly from the Notes Library landing page, you will see all notes associated with the tenants you have been assigned to.
- If you access Notes History, or if you are in the Notes Editor and have a tenant selected, you will only see notes associated with that tenant.

The following screen shows latest notes accessed from the Notes Library and not within the context of a tenant.
