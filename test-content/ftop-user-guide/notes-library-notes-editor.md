# Notes Editor

## Overview

The **Notes Editor** screen is for creating notes and updating drafts. When you open the Notes Editor, it is blank until you make your sections from the drop-down menu. As you make your selections from the drop-down menus it is populated.

>[!NOTE]
>This page can also be accessed from tasks within FTOP. You will find a link to **Create Notes** from the Status, Playbook, Time, and Services tabs.

## Procedures

### Creating a Note

You will select your Note Category, Tenant, and Services from the drop-down menus, insert template if you wish, draft your note, and specify next steps.

#### Select from drop-down menu

Specify your selections from the drop-down menus. When you see **Tenant** in the Notes category, it means you are applying a note at the tenant level.

|Drop-down Menu |Menu Items and Descriptions  |
|---------|---------|
|Notes Category    |Engagement Management<br>Technical Enablement<br>Service Intent<br>Environment         |
|Tenant   |List of tenants assigned to you. Select the tenant that you wish to create a note for, you can compose your note and save up to 10 drafts.          |
|Services    |List of services available. Select the services associated with the tenant that you would like your note to reference.   |
|Task Id    |An optional field. If you are accessing Create Note from within FTOP, the Task Id will be populated. If you enter an incorrect task id, you will see an error message "Value is not a valid Task Id."  |

At this point you are ready to compose your note. If you are composing a note for Engagement Management or Technical Enablement you can insert the optional template.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Insert the template before you start; otherwise, your content will be overwritten.

#### Enter content into text box

This area is used to write your note. Author your note in the note text box using rich text formatting, including linking. If you want to use the optional template, select it before you start.

#### Turn on escalated flag

Turn on the escalate flag if you want your note to appear on the Latest Notes and Search Notes Library screen. It will be marked red exclamation point and if it is less than one week old it will also have the recent note indicator. When you set the escalated flag, be aware that the flag does not trigger an automated notification.
