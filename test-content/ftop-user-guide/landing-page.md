# Landing Page

The landing page appears when you open FTOP and it displays general information that is divided into three sections: Title banner, Content Views and Tools,  and Announcements. On the left side of the window (often referred to as the left fly-out menu) you have a *FastTrack Guidance* menu. This menu expands to display links (*see FastTrack Guidance menu in this article*).
