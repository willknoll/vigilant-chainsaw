# Sample Agenda

## Title

Weekly Sync Meeting

## Agenda

Team, here's the agenda for this week's sync meeting (45 min):

1. Exchange configuration (Sally, FE), 20 min:
2. Pilot list (Sam, FM), 10 min: Review the current list of customers for pilot migration
3. Pilot timeline (Sam, FM), 10 min: Confirm the timeline to migrate the Pilot group
4. Outcomes & Next Steps (Sam, FM), 5 min: Confirm decisions and capture next steps

## Invite people you need

Make sure only the people needed are in the meeting.

The more people that attend your meeting, the more it has the potential for making it less effective. It's a good practice to only invite people who have a need to be in the meeting. Here are some good rules of thumb:

1. Is the person on the agenda? If the person doesn't have an active part in the agenda, consider them as optional, but make sure they get the meeting notes when the meeting ends.
2. If the person is on the agenda, do they have everyone they need to address the topic? For example, an FE may be leading a topic around email migration but will need the VMM on the call to answer specific questions that may come up.

## Manage time effectively

Meetings can get out of hand quickly if someone is not managing time during the meeting. Consider assigning a timekeeper to the meeting who can remind the attendees when agenda topics are approaching their allotted time.

>[!NOTE]
>Consider making 60-minute meetings only 45 minutes long and 30-minute meetings only 20 minutes. This will allow time after the meeting to send notes and actions before your next meeting.

## Appoint note-taker

Have someone who is not leading take notes. It's very hard to both facilitate a meeting and be the primary note-taker. If possible, ask someone ahead of time (either someone from the FTC or the customer) to be the note-taker.

>[!NOTE]
>Meeting notes shouldn't be a transcript of the meeting but should capture important decision and actions to be taken.

Here are some best practices for taking notes.

### How to take meeting notes

1. Restate the agenda – The agenda may have changed during the meeting. Putting that in the notes will give clarity to decisions and next steps.
2. List who attended – By knowing who attended, anyone associated with the project can go back to those people if they have questions.
3. List key decisions – Describe what the options were, the decisions (and why that decision was taken, if necessary).
4. List key actions – Document the actions, owners and timeline for delivery.
5. List key issues – Document issues that are active, owners, and timeline for resolution. Consider having a priority for each issue so the team knows what's most important.
