# Building a Successful Practice

As an approved FastTrack partner, you're uniquely positioned to help customers understand and take advantage of the FastTrack Benefit to successfully rollout Microsoft 365. You'll need to position the benefit in a clear, concise manner while showcasing your value-added, complementary services, and solutions.

## Recognizing success

Ultimately, we collectively want to provide great customer experiences that:

- Create customer business value.
- Generate customer interest in rolling out additional products and services.
- Provide opportunities to remain engaged with your clients by offering additional services and business value.
- Renew or expand customer subscriptions.

Get the FastTrack [Benefit Delivery Guide](https://aka.ms/FRPHubBenefitDeliveryGuide) to learn how.

## How to determine the benefit's scope

An important early step in the project is helping your customer understand what's within the FastTrack Benefit's scope and what additional value-added services they might need. Here are a few questions you can ask yourself to decide whether or not something falls within the FastTrack scope:

- Can all the guidance the customer requires be successfully delivered remotely?
- Is the customer willing and able to run assessment tools, analyze results, and remediate issues with hands-off remote assistance?
- Does the customer have the sponsorship and project management capabilities to lead a successful onboarding effort?

If the answers to these questions are yes, the customer is a candidate for benefit-only assistance, which you may deliver. Questions that a customer answers with no are opportunities for you to provide additional assistance or value-added services, wrapped around the FastTrack Benefit.

## Value-added services examples

You're uniquely equipped to deliver value-added services that can accelerate your customers' journeys to the cloud. Here are some examples:

- Project management
- Business solutions integrated with Microsoft Cloud services
- Putting onsite project management or technical resources to work in lieu of or to complement the customer team
- Workshops and solutions to help customers derive business value
- Data migration services that are out of FastTrack scope

To learn more about providing value-added services along with the FastTrack Benefit, see the [Statement of Work example](https://aka.ms/FRPHubStatementofWorkExample).

### Defining your FastTrack project scope

A Statement of Work (SOW) can help define both the FastTrack Benefit and your value-added services, so customers can understand and agree to all aspects of the project. The SOW should include the following components:

- Description of the FastTrack Benefit and value-added services
- Partner and customer roles and responsibilities
- Timeline based on customer intent and resource plan
- Key project service deliverables
- Areas out of scope
- Service deliverable acceptance process
- Project governance
