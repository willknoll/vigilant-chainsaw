# FRP COVID-19 Response

In response to the global **COVID-19 outbreak,** companies, schools, and service providers have turned to remote access communications to protect individuals and deter the spread of the COVID-19 virus. To assist organizations in all regions that are unable to support a remote work model Microsoft has set up a free six-month [Microsoft Teams Cloud Service Provider (CSP) trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/partners/news/article/acquire-new-and-upsell-current-customers-with-new-microsoft-teams-trial) This trial was announced to the general public March 3, 2020.

The FastTrack Ready Partner team anticipates that many trial customers will require assistance. We know each of you stand ready with your experience and expertise to help! Please reference the [FRP COVID-19 response slide deck](https://www.yammer.com/office365partners/#/files/464469098496). It is our hope that we can assist public health and safety by making working remotely easier.

## Documentation, Tools, and Incentives

### FTOP Notes #covid Hashtag

For customers that request M365 deployment assistance or shifted deployment/adoption priorities due to COVID-19 (e.g. Teams), we're asking the **#covid hashtag** be added to the Engagement Management and/or Service Intent notes fields along with additional details on how COVID-19 has changed the customer's priorities. For general guidance on using the notes tool, click [FTOP Notes](https://partner-docs.microsoft.com/partner-site/fasttrack-playbook/english-playbook/guidance-ftop-notes-guidance-partner.html).

### Required COVID-19 Customer Registration Tool  

For trial SKU's you **must** use the [FRP Covid Registration](https://aka.ms/FRPCovidRegistration) tool to register COVID-19 customers for onboarding incentive consideration and to register tenants for Student Enablement fee consideration.

For new customers **using normal paid SKUs,** partners will register them through CPOR. Partners have also had incentives associated with usage realization. It is important for us to track the impact of COVID-19 on our demand and capacity. We also want to understand shifting customer priorities on workload deployment and adoption.
