# Guidelines for Handling Personally Identifiable Customer Information (GDPR)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a standard that applies to individuals in the European Union (EU) to ensure the freedom of user control over personally identifiable information (PII) and to have confirmation it is not processed or shared without consent. Companies face strict fines for not complying with the standards set by the GDPR. As you might have guessed, Microsoft is GDPR-compliant.

In FastTrack we collect PII, such as customer contact names, email addresses, titles, phone numbers, migration and other content (customer file folders, etc.). Per the GDPR, we must delete or export PII within 30 days if a customer requests it.

The following are the guidelines:

- If a customer asks you to *delete* their FastTrack PII data, ask the customer contact or their Tenant Admin to send that request to O365FTGDPR@microsoft.com
- If a customer asks you to *export* their FastTrack PII data, their Tenant Admin must send a request to export to O365FTGDPR@microsoft.com
- If a customer tells you they aren’t the right FastTrack contact, proactively delete them from FTOP, by doing the following:

Go to FTOP > Search by Customer Name to pull up record > Contacts tab > Delete contact 

If your customer would like to ask Microsoft a privacy question, please direct them to http://aka.ms/privacyresponse.

In event of Microsoft customer data breach (i.e. accidental or intentional release of customer PII to untrusted environment):

- Follow your company’s internal processes for data breach
- Notify your Microsoft PSM, who will follow the internal Microsoft process ([//reportitnow](http://reportitnow/))
