# COVID Response  

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations all over the world have begun to setup remote work and remote learning for their employees and students. FastTrack is supporting all Education, Health, Non-Profit, Government, Enterprise, and Commercial customers that need assistance responding to COVID-19. The FastTrack Ready Partner team anticipates that many trial customers will require assistance. We know each of you stand ready with your experience and expertise to help! Please reference the [FRP COVID-19 response slide deck](https://www.yammer.com/office365partners/#/files/464469098496). It is our hope that we can assist public health and safety by making working remotely easier.

To support this effort, the FastTrack service description has been updated to include additional [Eligible Services and Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/m365-eligible-services-and-plans) (including Trial SKU's). In addition, FastTrack is also taking exception requests to the eligibility criteria so we can help as many customers as possible across all workloads.  

***Our focus is to be of service to all customers, and to be extremely simple to engage while ensuring that we are not attempting to profit from this situation.***  

## FRP Documentation, Tools, and Incentives

### FTOP Notes #covid Hashtag

For customers that request M365 deployment assistance or shifted deployment/adoption priorities due to COVID-19 (e.g. Teams), we're asking the **#covid hashtag** be added to the Engagement Management and/or Service Intent notes fields along with additional details on how COVID-19 has changed the customer's priorities. For general guidance on using the notes tool, click [FTOP Notes](https://partner-docs.microsoft.com/partner-site/fasttrack-playbook/english-playbook/guidance-ftop-notes-guidance-partner.html).

### Required COVID-19 Customer Registration Tool  

For trial SKU's you **must** use the [FRP Covid Registration](https://aka.ms/FRPCovidRegistration) tool to register COVID-19 customers for onboarding incentive consideration and to register tenants for Student Enablement fee consideration.

For new customers **using normal paid SKUs,** partners will register them through CPOR. Partners have also had incentives associated with usage realization. It is important for us to track the impact of COVID-19 on our demand and capacity. We also want to understand shifting customer priorities on workload deployment and adoption.
