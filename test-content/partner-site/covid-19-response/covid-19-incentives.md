# COVID-19 On-boarding Incentives

We have added incentives associated with usage realization. It is important for us to track the impact of COVID-19 on demand and capacity. We also want to understand shifting customer priorities on workload deployment and adoption.  

On-boarding incentives are available to FRP Partners when they assist with on-boarding E1/G1/A5 trial SKU's. A Student Enablement fee, equivalent to the value of the Teams incentive for eligible tenants, has been added. The FastTrack Ready Partners [Terms & Conditions](https://aka.ms/fasttrackreadyterms) have been updated to reflect incentives.

## FRP Dashboard: How to monitor COVID-19 Engagements

On April 21, 2020 two changes in the FRP Dashboard were added to assist monitoring the progress for tenants flagged as Covid-19 engagements. 

A filter in the FRP Dashboard will only select tenants with hashtag #covid. *Note: The guidance is to ***use #covid,*** but as some people also used #covid19, both are included in the filter.*

In addition, a dedicated Data Health tab for COVID-19 tenants has been created.
