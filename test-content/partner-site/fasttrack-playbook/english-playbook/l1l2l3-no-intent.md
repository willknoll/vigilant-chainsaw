There is lack of awareness, conviction or sponsorship at the decision-making levels in the company to move to the cloud, or to prioritize implementation and usage. Selling of business value is needed.

## [L2 - Using Competetive Solution](l1l2l3-no-intent-using-competitive-solution.md)

The customer has no intent to use the service because they are using a competitive solution. The case to use the Microsoft service is not compelling or has not been made to the customer. Selling of economic or business value, or a better value proposition is needed.
