# Partner Engagement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Definition:** Delay in partner selection/contracting or the partner is blocked with Technical Deployment and/or Adoption Support (Scope Limitation, limited experience, etc.).​

## Valid Example Scenarios:

| Valid Example Scenario | Scenario Status |

| Customer is asking Microsoft to find an appropriate partner. | Partner Engagement |
| Partner has Statement of Work (SOW) for specific workloads and will not be deploying full suite. | Partner Engagement |

> [!TIP]
> If you are still unsure about using this L2, here are some questions to ask the customer to confirm if this is the appropriate L2 to be used:
>    1. Does the partner have the correct skills?
>    2. Are they having problems finding a partner?
>    3. Are there issues with the relationship of the partner and customer?
>    4. Is the partner responding to Microsoft?​
