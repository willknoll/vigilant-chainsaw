# COVID Response  

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, organizations all over the world have begun to setup remote work and remote learning for their employees and students. FastTrack is supporting all Education, Health, Non-Profit, Government, Enterprise, and Commercial customers that need assistance responding to COVID-19 through the RFA (Request for Assistance) process at [www.microsoft.com/fasttrack](http://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack).  

To support this effort, the FastTrack service description has been updated to include additional [Eligible Services and Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/m365-eligible-services-and-plans) (including Trial SKU's). In addition, FastTrack is also taking exception requests to the eligibility criteria so we can help as many customers as possible across all workloads.  

***Our focus is to be of service to all customers, and to be extremely simple to engage while ensuring that we are not attempting to profit from this situation.***  

This version of the playbook broadly supports the remote-work needs of our customer, and guides them in the enablement of the **Teams** and **Security** scenarios. Additional scenarios will be addressed in future versions of the playbook in the coming weeks.
