# Enable Phase

The Enable Phase identifies how the FastTrack team performs a technical enablement of services that the customer plans to adopt and includes the core infrastructure setup for all services, such as custom domains, network configuration, identity integration and authentication. When core infrastructure setup is complete, the FastTrack team works to provision and enable individual services. When data migration is in scope, this process occurs after the service is enabled.

The processes within this phase include:

-  [Enable Services](enable-enable-services-partner.md)
-  [Conduct Engagement Completion Discussion (Enablement)](enable-conduct-engagement-completion-discussion-partner.md)
