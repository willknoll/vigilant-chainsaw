# Overview

In response to the global **COVID-19 outbreak,** companies, schools, and service providers have turned to remote access communications to protect individuals and deter the spread of the COVID-19 virus. To assist organizations in all regions that are unable to support a remote work model Microsoft has set up a free six-month [Microsoft Teams Cloud Service Provider (CSP) trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/partners/news/article/acquire-new-and-upsell-current-customers-with-new-microsoft-teams-trial) This trial was announced to the general public March 3, 2020.

The FastTrack Ready Partner team anticipates that many trial customers will require assistance. We know each of you stand ready with your experience and expertise to help! Please reference the [FRP COVID-19 response slide deck](https://www.yammer.com/office365partners/#/files/464469098496). It is our hope that we can assist public health and safety by making working remotely easier.

## Documentation, Tools, and Incentives

### FTOP Notes #covid Hashtag

For customers that request M365 deployment assistance or shifted deployment/adoption priorities due to COVID-19 (e.g. Teams), we're asking the **#covid hashtag** be added to the Engagement Management and/or Service Intent notes fields along with additional details on how COVID-19 has changed the customer's priorities. For general guidance on using the notes tool, click [FTOP Notes](https://partner-docs.microsoft.com/partner-site/fasttrack-playbook/english-playbook/guidance-ftop-notes-guidance-partner.html).

### Required COVID-19 Customer Registration Tool  

For trial SKU's you **must** use the [FRP Covid Registration](https://aka.ms/FRPCovidRegistration) tool to register COVID-19 customers for onboarding incentive consideration and to register tenants for Student Enablement fee consideration.

For new customers **using normal paid SKUs,** partners will register them through CPOR. Partners have also had incentives associated with usage realization. It is important for us to track the impact of COVID-19 on our demand and capacity. We also want to understand shifting customer priorities on workload deployment and adoption.

### COVID-19 On-boarding Incentives

We have added incentives associated with usage realization. It is important for us to track the impact of COVID-19 on demand and capacity. We also want to understand shifting customer priorities on workload deployment and adoption.  

On-boarding incentives are available to FRP Partners when they assist with on-boarding E1/G1/A5 trial SKU's. A Student Enablement fee, equivalent to the value of the Teams incentive for eligible tenants, has been added. The FastTrack Ready Partners [Terms & Conditions](https://aka.ms/fasttrackreadyterms) have been updated to reflect incentives.

## FRP Dashboard: How to monitor COVID-19 Engagements

On April 21, 2020 two changes in the FRP Dashboard were added to assist monitoring the progress for tenants flagged as Covid-19 engagements. 

A filter in the FRP Dashboard will only select tenants with hashtag #covid. *Note: The guidance is to ***use #covid,*** but as some people also used #covid19, both are included in the filter.*

In addition, a dedicated Data Health tab for COVID-19 tenants has been created.

**New dashboard:**

![COVID-19 Filters](media/covid-19-filters.png "#covid")

**How to use the filter:**

When the dashboard is filtered on **#covid** engagements you can monitor your tenants for Teams usage and take action on those that are not progressing as expected, for example, those at 1.72 % of usage.

![COVID-19 Engagements](media/covid-19-engagements.png "COVID-19 Engagements")

**Data Health for Covid19 engagements**

- The existing Data Health tab in the FRP Dashboard **only shows workloads with an approved CPOR claim** (eligible for incentives)​
- Most **COVID-19 engagements are for E1/G1 trial tenants they don’t have an associated CPOR claim​**
- We added the **COVID-19 Data Health** tab **automatically filtered on tenants with the #covid tag** in the notes

![COVID-19 Data Health Tab](media/covid-19-data-health-tab.png "COVID-19 Data Health Tab")

>[!Note]
> The new tab has been added to **help monitor the COVID-19 engagements only.** It **will NOT contribute to the Data Health KPI calculation.** For program eligibility we will continue to use the **existing global Data Health Tab.**
