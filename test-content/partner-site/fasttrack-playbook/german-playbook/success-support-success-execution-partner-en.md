# Support Success Execution

## Overview

The Support Success Execution process identifies how FastTrack supports its customers after their Microsoft 365 (M365) services are launched, and when their business goals are achieved, and subsequent value is realized. Blockers/challenges are addressed to drive target active usage (AU) percentages, meet customer success metrics, and prepare the customer for the Success Review process.

## Objectives

  - When a Customer Success Manager (CSM) is aligned to a custome​​r and a Modern Communications service (Outlook Mobile, Teams or Yammer) is enabled, contact the CSM to take over the Success and Adoption activities.
  - Maintain a regular communication cadence with the customer by offering encouragement and guidance to realize and sustain momentum.
  - Track customer progress and status to ensure the Customer Success Plan (CSP) is executed effectively and to increase AU to the minimal 10% or a usage metric aligned with the customer's success criteria.
  - Provide support to identify, address, and resolve blockers/challenges impacting the customer's AU and adoption
    experience.

## Approach

### CSM Handshake for Modern Comms

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **Outlook Mobile / Teams / Yammer**

For accounts with CSM assigned to the customer and for each of these 3 enabled workloads **Outlook Mobile, Teams, and Yammer** execute the appropriate task to conduct a "handshake" to the CSM to drive service adoption.

If a CSM is assigned and the workload is Outlook Mobile, Teams or Yammer, do not execute the Schedule Success Check-in Meetings or Encourage Customer to Track Adoption Progress tasks.
