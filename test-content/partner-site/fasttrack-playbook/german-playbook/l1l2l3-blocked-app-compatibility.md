| Is there a third-party application that will not work in SharePoint Online (SPO)? Requires SharePoint on-premises solution. | App Compatibility |
| If an existing application (e.g., LOB, third party add-in) needs to work (usually Office Pro-Plus (OPP) and SharePoint Online (SPO) and is not able to. | App Compatibility |
| Customer needs Microsoft Online Product to perform specific function which is currently unavailable.  | App Compatibility |

> [!TIP]
> If you are still unsure about using this L2, here are some questions to ask the customer to confirm if this is the appropriate L2 to be used:
>    1.​ Have they done testing with other applications, such as Salesforce, or accounting-specific applications?
