# Sign in to FTOP Using Your Org ID Credentials

## Overview

By the onboarding phase of the FastTrack Ready Partner Program you should have established your Partner Center Credentials, which are Microsoft Org ID credentials - your user principal name + password in the format of an e-mail address, e.g. johndoe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com or johndoe@contoso.com

You must have Partner Org ID credentials to access the FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP).
