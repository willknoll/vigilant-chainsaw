## Partner Center Org ID Credentials - A step-by-step process

This guide is intended for FastTrack Ready Partners (FRP) and others who require an understanding of the Partner Center portal, enrollment and onboarding, and Partner Center user credentials with respect to the FRP program.

**Prerequisite:** Readers should be familiar with the [FastTrack Ready Partner Program.](http://aka.ms/ftpartnerguide)

### Partner Center credentials for FastTrack Ready Partner tools

Partner Center credentials (user principal name + password) are Microsoft Organization IDs (Org ID) established through the Partner Center. Org ID credentials are associated with an [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-whatis/) and allow a user to:

1. authenticate to Azure Active Directory
2. be authorized for Microsoft cloud properties

While most partners are familiar with Org ID credentials, it is important to note that with the FRP Program, the partner’s tenant must be enrolled through the Partner Center portal, Microsoft’s primary portal for all cloud services partners.

The benefit to using Org ID credentials is that the partner remains in control of their users, the privileges granted to their users, and their access to the various FRP tools. All FRP users must have Partner Center credentials to use the partner-facing FastTrack Ready tools, including:

- [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com) for partner tenant creation and management of marketing profiles. If the partner is also enrolled in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, partners can use the Partner Center portal manage and administer customers, provision (sell) subscriptions to customers, etc.

- [FastTrack Portal](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com) for Request for Assistance (RFA) form submission and management.

- [FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP)](https://ftop.microsoft.com) for FastTrack customer management.

- [PowerBI for reporting](ftop-partner-user-guide/../../power-bi-reporting-guide/index.md)
