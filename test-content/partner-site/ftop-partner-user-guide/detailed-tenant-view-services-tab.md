#### Entitlements Status

The Entitlement Status section enables you to **update entitlement status for a service.**

For specific L1 to L3 taxonomy definitions and example scenarios, see [Status and Entitlement Home](../fasttrack-playbook/english-playbook/status-guidance-entitlement-status-notes-partner.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The entitlements must total the available entitlements. If the conditions are not met, you will see an error message.

When you open the Services tab, the services display. Within services you can **add, edit, or delete entitlements** when you have the appropriate permissions to the tenant.

![entitlement-status-services-add-entitlement-status-partner.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/entitlement-status-services-add-entitlement-status-partner.png "Service entitlement status detail")

To update the Entitlement Status for a service, select the **add entitlement status** button. Before you enter an Entitlement Status note, make sure that you understand how to write a great note. See [Entitlement Status Notes Guidance](../fasttrack-playbook/english-playbook/status-guidance-entitlement-status-notes-partner.md), which includes examples, note templates for various classifications, and how the notes could be worded in different situations.

> [!NOTE]
> A great note should show a green confidence level. When you write your note, please ensure you have clearly articulated the intent, or lack thereof, and the primary reason (if the customer does not have intent or is blocked).

The following procedures provide step-by-step instructions to add, edit, and delete an entitlement status.

#### To add entitlement status

The following sequence demonstrates how to the add an entitlement status with a status note that generates a high confidence value. Remember, the **Enter Status Note** field is appropriate for capturing intent and reason.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to provide additional status about the service, use the Overall Status Note on the Status tab. For instructions, see [Status tab](detailed-tenant-view-status-tab.md), and review the procedure [To Create Notes or Review Notes History](notes-library.md).

1. Enter **Status Note**.

![entitlement-status-services-add-entitlement-status.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/entitlement-status-services-add-entitlement-status.png "Add Entitlement Status")

2. Select **Suggest**. The screen refreshes based on the information you entered in the Status Note.

The following screen shows an example of a great note.

![entitlement-status-services-add-entitlement-status-enter-status-note-suggest.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/entitlement-status-services-add-entitlement-status-enter-status-note-suggest.png "Add Entitlement Status Suggest")

3. Select **Add**.

4. Move the Entitlements.

![entitlement-status-services-add-entitlement-status-save.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/entitlement-status-services-add-entitlement-status-save.png "Entitlement Status Services Add Entitlement Status Save")

6. Select **Save**.

![entitlement-status-services-saved.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/entitlement-status-services-saved.png "Entitlement Status Services Saved")

In the next scenario, the screen shows an example of a marginal note, this note is marginal because a reason was not provided.

![entitlement-status-services-marginal-note.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/entitlement-status-services-marginal-note.png "Marginal Note")

The following screen shows an example of a poor note. You can tell it is a poor note because of the confidence level indicator and because you cannot select Add. The status note does not provide enough information.

![entitlement-status-services-poor-note.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/entitlement-status-services-poor-note.png "Poor Note")

Directly below the entitlements grid is a section called the *Technical Service Notes*. These notes are designed to provide the FM/FE with a place to include technical notes about the service that do not impact the consumption status.

![technical-service-notes-partners.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/technical-service-notes-partners.png "Technical service notes")

![overall-notes-history-tab-partner.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-status-tab/overall-notes-history-tab-partner.png "Notes History")

>[!NOTE]
> The Overall Notes History section is now a consolidated display of all notes for the tenant (not just overall status notes).

#### Adoption Indicators

The Adoption Indicators are used to capture D.I.B.S. and S.S.A.T. data for the service.

Each field is a pre-defined set of options you can select.

![adoption-indicators-showing-editing.png](media/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/adoption-indicators-showing-editing.png "Adoption indicators showing editing")

For specific guidance on capture D.I.B.S. and S.S.A.T. see the [guidance document](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTOP/OneAdoptionWizard/Guidance_when_4+4_not_present.docx?web=1).

#### Data Migration

For services that are eligible for data migration, use Data Migration section to determine whether Microsoft will be responsible for migrating the service.

If the *Microsoft performing migration?* box is not checked, the dialog provides a drop-down list to define the reason Microsoft is not performing the migration as well as a notes field.

![data-migration-microsoft-not-performing-migration.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/data-migration-microsoft-not-performing-migration.png "Data migration microsoft not performing migration")

If the *Microsoft performing migration?* box is checked, a new table appears that enables the user to define the type of migration and number of entitlements.

![data-migration-showing-no-scenario-selected.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/data-migration-showing-no-scenario-selected.png "Data migration showing no scenario selected")

Select a scenario from the **Please Select** drop-down list and select **+ plus icon**. The scenario is added to the table and additional fields appear.

![data-migration-showing-migration-scenario.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/data-migration-showing-migration-scenario.png "Data-migration showing migration scenario")

> [!NOTE]
> You can add multiple scenarios, but the total number of entitlements must exactly match the number of In Progress entitlements for the service.

#### Delivery

The Delivery section defines the Engagement Scenario and defines Delivery teams (members or groups). For Engagement Scenario, FTOP defaults to **Customer-Led with FTP Assist**.

#### FastTrack-ready partner forecasting

The following fields capture the dates for when the service it planned to meet the milestones for 10% and 40% active use. The Max AU date is not currently used.

1. Enter the dates from the date picker, if available, for the Target Date for 10% AU and Target Date for 40% AU.

1. Select **Save**. If there is no Submitted Date (RFA) visible, then the forecast dates cannot be saved, and an error will appear. The dates entered need to be in chronological order. For example, the Target Date for 10% AU cannot be earlier that the Submitted Date (RFA) and the same is true for Target Date for 40% AU, etc.

![fasttrack-partner-forecast-showing-no-submitted-date-rfa.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/fasttrack-partner-forecast-showing-no-submitted-date-rfa.png "FastTrack partner forecast showing no submitted date rfa")

3. Select **Save**. You will return to the services list.

Each time you save a new date in either of these fields, the history of this change records in the History table.

![fasttrack-partner-showing-no-submitted-date-rfa.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/fasttrack-partner-showing-no-submitted-date-rfa.png "FastTrack partner showing no submitted date rfa")

#### Assignments

Assignments are managed through the contextual menu in Portfolio View. See [Assignment](portfolio-view-summary-view.md).

![assignments-editing.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/assignments-editing.png "Assignments editing")

#### Note History

At the bottom of the page is a new note history section. This section displays a running history of service entitlement and technical service notes related to the service. The most recent notes are displayed at the top.

![service-note-history.png](media/power-bi-reporting-guide/detailed-tenant-view-services-tab/service-note-history.png "Service note history")

### Viewing service details

When View is selected, the service detail information opens in a read-only format. This is the only option available to users that are not assigned to the tenant.

The view page is divided in seven sections: entitlement status details, technical service notes, adoption indicators, data migration, delivery, assignments, and notes history.

This section will not go into detail about this page because it is a read-only version of the service editing page.
