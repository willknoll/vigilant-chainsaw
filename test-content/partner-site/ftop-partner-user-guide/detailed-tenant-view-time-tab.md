# Time Tab

## Overview

### Time Entry

Enter the time you spent working on a task in the **service time entry** section.

> [!NOTE]
> Instead of entering time on individual tasks, enter your time in a specific group of tasks under the Initiate phase. This group of tasks is called **Service Time Entry** and contains a task for each supported service.

The following figure shows a task that has not had any time entered.

#### To track your time

1. Enter your time, click **start**. A timer begins tracking your time on a task until you click **finish**, **restart**, **cancel**, or **edit**.

2. Click **finish**  to stop the clock and save the time based on the duration of the timer. The **start and finish approach are not useful in most scenarios** because many people do not start the timer when they start a task. Instead, most users simply edit the time entry (After you click **finish**, the edit option appears.)

3. Click **edit** to manually enter the start and end times or enter the time (in minutes) directly.

4. Entering your time, click **save**.

> [!NOTE]
> Once a time entry is saved it cannot be deleted. You can edit the time of an entry, but all time-entries must have a minimum of one minute.

5. Click **restart** to restart the clock.

6. Click **cancel** to cancel the clock or cancel the edit.

The time you spend on each phase of onboarding is a critical metric of the FastTrack process; therefore, tracking the time you spend working with, or on behalf of a tenant, is vital to your role.

In some cases, you may be required to work with a customer to whom you are not assigned. This might happen in the case of a consultation, filling in for an absent FE or FM, or assisting on an issue about which you have expertise. In those cases, you need to add yourself to the tenant as an FE or FM, which enables you to track your time.

### Notes

Task notes are an optional section that enables you to save notes specific to the task.

#### To create a note

**Create Notes**

1. If you wish to record notes for this customer, select **Create Notes** to open the Note Editor.
