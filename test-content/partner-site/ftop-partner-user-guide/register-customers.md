# Register Customers

## Customer Association

Itâ€™s required that partners claim (or register) all customers and workloads/services in the Partner Center using the Claiming Partner of Record (CPOR) customer association tool. Once a claim has been approved in the Partner Center, the data will flow into FTOP and will be automatically assigned to the claiming FRP partner.

>[!Note]
> This process can take up to 2 weeks including: the CPOR approval process, customer opt out waiting period, and data sync processing between the two systems.

For instructions on claiming customers and workloads for the OSU-M365 Incentive Program, refer to [OSU and OSA Claims Guide](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassetsprod.microsoft.com%2Fmpn%2Fen-us%2Fclaiming-partner-record-claims-guide.pptx&data=02%7C01%7Cv-cekenn%40microsoft.com%7C49daec7960a74e76c5e208d7e7d5d5d3%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637232777978313130&sdata=MA3D4VrKwVEsXhu%2FNZV8RAgT0k%2FX6uV%2FiEKzXcJ6PIk%3D&reserved=0) (including CPOR).
