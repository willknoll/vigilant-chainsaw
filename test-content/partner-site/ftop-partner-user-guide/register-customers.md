# Register Customers

## Customer Association

Itâ€™s required that partners claim (or register) all customers and workloads/services in the Partner Center using the Claiming Partner of Record (CPOR) customer association tool. Once a claim has been approved in the Partner Center, the data will flow into FTOP and will be automatically assigned to the claiming FRP partner.

>[!Note]
> This process can take up to 2 weeks including: the CPOR approval process, customer opt out waiting period, and data sync processing between the two systems.

For instructions on claiming customers and workloads for the OSU-M365 Incentive Program, refer to [OSU and OSA Claims Guide](https://aka.ms/FRPCPORClaimsGuide) (including CPOR).

For instructions on Partner Center User Management and OSU-M365 Incentive Program enrollment steps, refer to the [Modern Enrollment Guide.](http://aka.ms/osuenrollmentguide)
