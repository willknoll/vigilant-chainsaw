### Engagement Scenario is not FTC-FTP Led Tab

Use this report to view services on tenants where you are assigned, where the engagement scenario is not set to FTP Led or Assist. **Action should be taken to ensure that all services being delivered by your organization are appropriately set to FTP Led or Assist.** This is especially important as **payment is not made if this is not set to FTP Led.**

Microsoft Fasttrack Center has 5 Engagement Scenarios to reflect who is leading delivery of the benefit:

- **FTP Led or Assist** – You, the FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP) are delivering the benefit
- **Customer Led** – The customer has opted to manage their own deployment and adoption
- **CSS Led or Assist** – The FastTrack Center (FTC) team, part of Microsoft’s CSS organization is delivering the benefit 
- **CXP** – The Customer Experience Team (CXP) from within Microsoft engineering is delivering the benefit 
- **Non-Fasttrack Partner Led** – A partner, outside of the FRP program is helping the customer with deployment and adoption 

There can be instances where more than one delivery team has engaged with a customer over time or where different teams are focused on different services, and it shows up in this report. 

At the bottom of the page, click the **Engagement Scenario is not FTC-FTP Led tab.**
