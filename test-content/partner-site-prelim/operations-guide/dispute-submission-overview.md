## Payment and Dispute Overview

If there is a discrepancy between your records and the Proof of Execution (POE) statement you receive, you can submit an appeal to the [FRP Payment Disputes site](https://fasttrackreadysupport.com/) for review.

**Notes:**

- This site is optimized for Edge. Some functionality may be lost if using a different browser.
- Before you can submit a milestone dispute, you must be fully onboarded to the FastTrack Ready Partner Program and you must have a corporate Office 365 account. Also, your Payment Central account must be completely setup for your business.

If you have any questions, please contact us at: svcadopt@microsoft.com.

You can watch the following [demonstration video](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/partners/videos/fasttrack-ready-partner-payment-disputes-site) or use the step-by-step instructions in this guide to understand how to use the site.
