motion and when migration is complete.​  

## Objectives

  - Customer has education and knowledge on completing the RFA form for future requests/inquiries.  
  - Customer has tools for the successful adoption of newly implemented cloud services.

  - Customer engagement is closed.  

## Approach

    - Direction to have engagement completion review with the customer.

      - FTCQ Inactive APJ  
      - FTCQ Inactive EMEA
