>    1.​ Did the customer purchase the correct platform (dedicated/vnext/GCC) such as government?
>    2. ​Are they changing tenants? Will their licenses be moving to another tenant?
>    3. Are they having issues with qualifying Office 365 (O365) as a capital expense?
>    4. Are they stalled in EA/contract negotiations?
>    5. Are they asking for features that are not available in their current subscription (E1/E3/E5)?​
