# Partner Communications

## Timeline

*Submission date* – Change owners must provide the FTC info blog communications draft to the FTC readiness team and the Partner readiness team no later than **10 business days prior to the CM release date**.

*Publish date* – Partner communications are published via a bi-weekly “Heads Up” newsletter. The content will be added to the next newsletter that may present before or after the release date (to be ageed-upon with the change owner).

*Time-sensitive material* – Urgent announcements can be posted to Yammer at any time for Partner comms. Work with Julie Martin (v-julmar) to publish.  

## Process

1. Change owner fills out the [ftc info blog template](https://aka.ms/ftcib), per requirements below. This content will be used for the FTC info post and the partner communications.

2. Change owner attaches the completed template to the associated child task in Azure Dev Ops named *Ring 1: Readiness - Communications: Create change communications* to send the communication to the readiness team.

3. Change communications are posted on the Heads Up newsletter and Yammer.

## Format

Change communications must adhere to comms template at [ftc info blog template](https://aka.ms/ftcib).

### Overall Requirements

- Keep communication to 200 words or less so that delivery teams can read and quickly understand the change.

- Do not include graphics or tables in the main post. If needed, graphics, tables, and FAQs can be provided in a separate doc and hyperlinked in the Reference Material section.

- Sections are not optional. If the section is not applicable, enter N/A.

### Section Requirements

#### Change Management Request (CMR)

- Provide a link to the parent CMR in the title of your communication, i.e., CMR #, cmr title and release date.

#### Action Required

- List the audience for this change by FastTrack and Partner role.

- List any specific action required of the role. The FTC info blog provides role tagging that enables the roles to filter communications relevant to them.

- If awareness only, list which roles need to be informed.

#### Reason for change

- Describe the reason for the change. This section should include the problem being solved and the proposed solution as outlined in the parent CMR form for this change.

#### Impact of change

- Provide how this change will impact what the audience does today.

    - Provide the expected outcomes.

#### Partner Content

- Unlike FastTrack roles, partners are not required to use our materials or follow our specific process. Our communications need to quickly and simply describe how the resource or process change can make their engagement simpler or drive additional business for them. Use this section to help partners understand the impact to their business.

- Original example:
    - Impact of Change
        - Re-engagement FMs will have a consistent approach to pitching EMS value to customers.
        - EMS detailed, key delivery scenarios will help drive intent.

- Improved example:
    - Impact of Change  
        - *Enterprise Mobility + Security Business Value Deck*
        - FastTrack now supports three main legs of security; Azure Active Directory, Intune, and Azure Information Protection.  We’ve created a business value presentation to show your customers scenarios tied to these areas of Enterprise Mobility + Security.  Not too high level and not diving into features, this presentation gets your customer thinking about ways to enable a more secure posture.
        - Deliver a consistent pitch on EMS with the Enterprise Mobility + Security Business Value Deck.

#### Playbook/FTOP Impact

- Describe what will change in the playbook based on work performed in Ring 1: Update Operations Playbook and FTOP Task Changes.
    
- Describe the impacts to the Playbook/FTOP related to this change:
    - Service: List the impacted service or workload
    - Phase: List the FastTrack phase that is affected by the change
    - Playbook: Describe how to conduct the workshop
    - Step: Describe the steps changed in the remediation checklist
    - Task: Describe the associated FTOP task, noting if it is mandatory

### Reference Material

- Ensure that content is accessible to Partners, content must be stored in the BCM or Partner Hub. Insert hyperlinks to supporting documentation in this section. Supporting documentation may include PowerPoint presentations, training modules, videos, web pages, and FAQs.

### Contact Information

- Provide the contact information of the change owner for questions and clarifications from the delivery team. Use a "mailto:" link to make it easier for users to contact change owners.
