# Partner Documentation

## Overview

The FastTrack Ready Partner Readiness and Communications team informs partners about program changes or updates to FastTrack resources and curated partner workload content from across Microsoft. We also provide role-specific training opportunities online. To learn more about our team and how we interface with FastTrack Change Management, please review the [Overview presentation](https://aka.ms/FRPReadinessComms).

During Triage, it will be determined whether a Change Item (CI) has partner impact and indicated in the Impacted Roles field of the CI. If so, change managers will need to work with the FRP team on communications, training, and documentation.

When a CI moves to the “Committed” stage, the FRP team will assign a task owner for the following documentation task: Update Partner Program Documentation. Please work with this person to execute the task.

Partners are unable to access the FastTrack Playbook, FTOP User Guide and other key documents available to the FTC. Instead, we publish all partner-relevant resources to the  FastTrack Ready Partner Hub.
