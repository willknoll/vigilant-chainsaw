# Partner Communications and Training

## Overview

The FastTrack Ready Partner Readiness and Communications team informs partners about program changes or updates, FastTrack resources, and curated partner workload content from across Microsoft. We also provide role-specific training opportunities online.

To learn more about our team and how we interface with FastTrack Change Management, please review the [Overview presentation](https://aka.ms/FRPReadinessComms).

During triage, it is determined whether a Change Item (CI) has partner impact and is indicated in the Impacted Roles field of the CI. If so, change managers will need to work with the FRP team on communications, training and documentation. 

When a CI moves to the “Committed” stage, the FRP team will assign a task owner for the Communication task: *Create Partner-friendly communication and training*. Please work with this person to execute the task.

Partners are unable to access the FTC Info Blog, Nexus and most content via the FTOP portal. Instead, we use the following channels to communicate with FRPs:  

- Bi-weekly [Heads Up Email newsletter](https://aka.ms/headsupnewsletter)

- FRP private [Yammer community](http://aka.ms/frpyammer)

- [FastTrack Ready Partner Hub](http://aka.ms/fasttrackready) (Includes the FastTrack Partner Playbook and FTOP Partner User Guide)

In addition, partners are unable to access FTC training including e-learning modules. Instead, we work with change managers to share content via the following live training opportunities:

- Monthly FastTrack Partner Manager (FPM) call

- Monthly partner success call (by region)

- [Live and recorded webinars](http://aka.ms/frpwebinars)

## Timeline

*Submission date* – Change owners should provide the [FTC info blog communications draft](http://aka.ms/ftcib) to the FTC Readiness team and the Partner readiness team no later than **10 business days prior to the CM release date**.

If partner training is required, change owners should submit the [FTC Readiness Training Details form](http://aka.ms/ftctd) as soon as possible. Webinar and partner calls require a **2-3 week lead time**.

*Publish date* – Partner communications are published via a bi-weekly “Heads Up” newsletter. The content will be added to the next newsletter that may present before or after the release date (to be agreed-upon with the change owner).

An FRP communications manager will work with the change owner to develop a training plan and assign content to the next FPM and Partner calls and possibly develop a webinar.

*Time-sensitive material* – Urgent announcements can be posted to Yammer or sent via email to partners at any time. Contact the [FRP Readiness Team](mailto:FRPReadiness@service.microsoft.com) to arrange.  

## Process

1. Change owners complete the [ftc info blog template](https://aka.ms/ftcib) and [Training Details Template](http://aka.ms/ftctd) for partners, per requirements below.

1. Change owner attaches the completed FTC Info Blog and training template(s) to the child task in Azure Dev Ops named *Create Partner-friendly communication and training*. Please tag the task owner to alert them that the templates are ready.

1. Change communications are posted in the next Heads Up newsletter and Yammer (as needed). A partner training plan is developed with the FRP communications manager assigned to the task.

## Format requirements for Partner communications

Unlike FastTrack roles, partners are not required to use our materials or follow our specific process. Our communications need to quickly and simply describe how the resource or process change can make their engagement simpler or drive additional business for them. This communication should help partners understand the impact of our materials and process to their business.

Please see below how a standard **FTC communication** was modified to meet partner needs. 

- Original example from FTC Info Blog post:

    - Impact of Change

        - Re-engagement FMs will have a consistent approach to pitching EMS value to customers.

        - EMS detailed, key delivery scenarios will help drive intent.

- Improved example for Partner Communications:

    - Enterprise Mobility + Security Business Value Deck

        - FastTrack now supports three main legs of security: Azure Active Directory, Intune, and Azure Information Protection. We’ve created a business value presentation to show your customers scenarios tied to these areas of Enterprise Mobility + Security. Not too high level and not diving into features, this presentation gets your customer thinking about ways to enable a more secure posture.

        - Deliver a consistent pitch on EMS with the Enterprise Mobility + Security Business Value Deck.

[**FastTrack Ready Partner Communications Template**](https://aka.ms/ftcib) – within FTC Info Blog Template (http://aka.ms/ftcib)

- Title (partner-friendly, no CI numbers)

- Brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) describing item and why it matters to partners

- Document and specific page where content needs to be updated or included

- Files that should be uploaded to [the Hub](http://aka.ms/fasttrackready)

- Links to other supporting material   

- Contact person for support

**FastTrack Ready Partner Readiness Template** – within [FastTrack Training Details Form](http://aka.ms/ftctd)

While all partner companies are structured differently, it is safe to assume they have parallel roles with the FTC, working to deploy the FastTrack benefit. Given that 80-100% of training materials are used by partners the goal should be to keep the partner in mind and create a single resource that can be used by all. Direction can be provided by the FRP Comms and Readiness team.

Because partners do not have access to the e-learning modules, there are other training opportunities to deliver your content, including:

1. Monthly Partner Community Calls (4th week of the month, Tues/Wed 3 regional calls)

1. Monthly Partner Webinars (scheduled at mutually agreeable timeslot)  

1. Recorded videos
