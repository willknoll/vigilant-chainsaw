# Delivery Training

## Overview

If your change impacts the delivery team, training material should be developed to support the change. All FTC training, regardless of format, is published to the Learning Path for the relevant role. Training for the FastTrack Ready Partner delivery channel is published to the FastTrack Ready Partner Hub. For more information, see [Partner Communications and Training](partner-communications-and-training.md).

An ADO task is automatically created to track the training needs of a CI. For changes which require FTC training, use the ADO task to communicate with the readiness team. For FastTrack Partner Training, use the task *Create Partner-friendly communication and training* in the Communications section. For changes that do not require training, change the “State” field of the task to Removed.

## Requesting Training

If you feel your CI requires training or if you are unsure, @mention the [FTCReadiness@microsoft.com](mailto:FTCReadiness@microsoft.com) in the training (child) task. The readiness team will work with you to determine the type of training required.

## Types of Training Available

Several FTC delivery mechanisms are available to address the training needs associated with your change item (CMR), including:  

- [E-learning Module](e-learning-module.md)  

- [Global Readiness Session](global-readiness-session.md)

- [E-learning/Global Readiness Hybrid and Airlift with E-learning Modules](e-learning-global-readiness-hybrid-and-airlift-with-e-learning-modules.md)

Once the type of training has been determined, the process for training creation will begin.

FastTrack Ready Partners are unable to access the types of training above. We instead offer them the following training methods: 

- Monthly Partner Community Calls (4th week of the month, Tues/Wed 3 regional calls)  

- Monthly Partner Webinars (scheduled at mutually agreeable timeslot)  

- Recorded videos

For more information, see [Partner Communications and Training](partner-communications-and-training.md).

## Timeline

All training must be completed and linked in the change communication 10 business days prior to release. The calendars below show milestones and handoffs that must occur to deliver training.

> [!NOTE]
> Triage occurs every Tuesday and Thursday.

## Compliance

- All content must be compliant to accessibility, global readiness, and licensing/privacy standards. The Readiness Team will verify compliance before publishing. For more information, review the compliance standards at [Worldwide Learning Compliance Policy Library](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/learning/GCL/Pages/Home.aspx?TAB=4%3AMBR%E2%80%8B%2C%20QBR%2C%20and%20BI).

## Dependencies

- CMR must be approved 15 business days before the FTC info blog is published. In the above example, the latest triage falls on the 21st of the prior month.

- Content from change owner must be available to the readiness team 15 days prior to when the FTC info blog is published.

- Change owner must adhere to established review schedule in order for content to be delivered on time.

- Change owner must submit training content the day after the CMR is approved.

- For CMR that requires training, approval should be contingent on having content available for training.

- Global readiness session must be delivered no later than the first week of the desired release month.
