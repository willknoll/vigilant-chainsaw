# FastTrack Style Guide

## General guidelines
    
### General content rules

  - Make sure that your writing is bias-free. Refer to the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2700) **Bias-free communication** section for complete guidance and examples.

  - Use gender-neutral or inclusive terms to refer to people.

  - Write out all product, solution, or offering names precisely and consistently.

  - Don’t overpromise or use words that make or imply promises. This can cause legal issues. Instead, qualify with words like *help*, *helps*, and *can help*.

  - Don’t write *Microsoft’s* (meaning *Microsoft is*).

  - Avoid jargon, slang, idioms, and colloquiums.

  - Don’t embed text in a graphic or image.

  - Use Segoe font.

  - Choose your words wisely and use them consistently. If you mean the same thing, use the same word.

  - Don’t use words that make or imply promises. This can cause legal issues.

  - Words like *safe*, *private*, *secure*, and *protect* can imply the promise of absolute security, safety, or privacy. Use thoughtfully (if at all).
    
      - In fictitious scenarios, use a variety of names. To find legally approved names for scenarios and examples, see [Approved fictitious names and guidelines](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/Home/Copyrights-Trademarks-and-Patents/Trademarks/Fictitious-Names) on [LCAWeb](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/LCAWeb/).
    
      - Be inclusive of job roles, family structure, leisure activities, and purchasing power.
    
      - Don’t generalize about people, countries, regions, and cultures, not even positive or neutral generalizations.
    
      - Avoid culturally sensitive terms, like terms associated with military or political actions, historic events, and eras.
    
### Capitalization

Microsoft general style is sentence-style capitalization.

  - Always capitalize proper nouns.

  - Use lowercase for everything except the first word in a sentence, user interface (UI) label, phrase, heading, or title (including the titles of blogs, articles, and press releases).

  - Don’t capitalize the spelled-out form of an acronym unless it's a proper noun.

  - In programming languages, follow the traditional capitalization of keywords and other special terms.

  - Don't use all uppercase for emphasis.
    
### Numbers, dates, and times
        
#### Spelled-out numbers

Use for:

  - Zero through nine, unless space is limited.

  - One of the numbers, when two numbers that refer to separate categories must appear together. For example, two 3-page articles.

  - At the beginning of a sentence.

  - Ordinal numbers, like first. Don't add *-ly*, as in *firstly*, to ordinal numbers.
    
#### Numerals

Use for:

  - Numbers in UI.

  - Numbers 10 or greater.

  - Numbers zero through nine when you have limited space.

  - All numbers in a category if one or more numbers requires a numeral. For example, a 16-page article, a 7-page article, and a 3-page article.

  - Dimensions. Use the multiplication sign (×), preceded and followed by a space, for tile sizes, screen resolutions, and paper sizes. For everything else, spell out by:
    
      - The time of day.
    
      - Percentages. Spell out *percent*.
    
      - The coordinates of tables or worksheets and numbered sections of documents.
        
#### Dates

  - Don’t use ordinal numbers, like June first or October twenty-eighth, for dates. Use a numeral instead.

  - Always spell out the name of the month.

  - Begin calendars on Mondays, which is the custom in much of the world.

  - Don’t refer to seasons, which vary across the world. Talk about quarters or specific months.

  - Use the date format, month dd, yyyy. Don’t use numerals to represent months. For example, *January 5*, *2018*.
    
#### Time

Include the time zone when it matters to customers, like in an event listing. In time stamps that automatically display the customer's local time, you don't need to include the time zone.

#### Ranges of numbers

  - In most cases, use *from* and *through* to describe a range of numbers.

  - Don’t use *from* before a range indicated by an en-dash, like 10–15.
    
### Punctuation

Always try and keep it simple.

  - Stick to short, simple sentences. Sentences that contain lots of punctuation tend to be complex and hard to read.

  - Use only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation points, and colons.
    
    Include commas after every item in a series, including the last one (this is called the Oxford comma). For example, *Networks, storage, and virtual machines.*

  - Use an apostrophe to indicate a missing letter in a contraction (like *don’t*) and to form the possessive case of a noun (as in *Insider’s Guide*). Don’t use an apostrophe for the possessive of it (*its*) to avoid confusion with the contraction of it is (*it’s*).

  - Use exclamation points sparingly.

  - Use question marks sparingly.

  - Don’t use spaces around em-dashes.

  - Don’t use a slash (/) to indicate a choice or as a substitute for *or*. Don’t use *and/or*.
    
### Abbreviations and acronyms

Acronyms and abbreviations can have an adverse effect on clarity, voice, and search engine optimization (SEO). However, some acronyms, like USB and PC, are widely understood and preferred to the spelled-out term.

As a rule, use only the abbreviations that are specified in the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2700) **A-Z word list and terms collections** section.

#### Latin

Avoid Latin abbreviations for common English phrases.

Don’t use *etc*. See the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2700) **and so on** section for alternatives.

| **Use this** | **Instead of this** |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| for example  | e.g.                |
| that is      | i.e.                |
| namely       | viz.                |
| therefore    | ergo                |

### Verb tense and addressing the user

In the present tense, the action is happening now. The present tense is easier to read and understand than the past or future tense. It’s the best choice for most content.

***Examples:***

  - The Windows Start screen is uniquely yours, personalized with your favorite apps, people, photos, and colors.

  - Windows Update installs important updates automatically.
    
#### Mood of verbs

The mood of a verb expresses the writer’s intent. Most of the time, use the indicative mood. It’s crisp and straightforward without being bossy. Don’t switch moods within a sentence.

| **Mood**        | **Use for**                                                                                               | **Examples**                                                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Indicative**  | Statements of fact, questions, assertions, and explanations—most Microsoft content.                       | Style sheets are powerful tools for formatting complex documents.     |
| **Imperative**  | Instructions, procedures, direct commands, requests, and headings for columns that list customer actions. | Enter a file name, and then save the file. **To do this Select this** |
| **Subjunctive** | Wishes, hypotheses, and suggestions—avoid.                                                                | We recommend that you be careful about opening email attachments.     |

#### Active and passive voice

Voice is either active or passive. Use active voice rather than passive voice whenever you can. In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. In passive voice, the subject is the receiver of the action.

  - Use verbs (like *is* and *open*) that indicate the action is happening now.

  - Avoid *will*, *was*, and verbs ending in *ed* (like *released*) which indicate that text isn't in the present tense.


|**Voice**  |**Examples**  |
|---------|---------|
|**Active**     |  Divide your document into as many sections as you want. <br> Office 365 includes the Office 2016 apps for PC and Mac.       |
|**Passive**     |   The site can’t be found. <br> The images will be provided.      |

#### Verb agreement

Verbs have singular and plural forms. Use the verb form that agrees with subject of the sentence in number. Try to stay consistent. Don’t intermingle singular and plural usage.

| **When the subject is**                               | **The verb is**                                  | **Examples**                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A group of things                                     | Singular                                         | A variety of games is available from the Windows Store.                     |
| Two or more singular things connected by *and*        | Plural                                           | Office 365 and Azure are both covered by FastTrack.                         |
| Two or more singular things connected by *or*         | Singular                                         | Your tablet or phone is all you need to play your favorite games on the go. |
| A singular thing and a plural thing connected by *or* | Singular or plural, to match the closest subject | Skype or social media apps are available from the Windows Store.            |

#### Person

In grammar, person refers to the point of view represented by a statement and determines which pronoun to use.

Use second person as often as you can.

In second person, you write as though you're speaking to the reader. Second person often uses the personal pronoun you, but sometimes the word you is implied. It supports a friendly, human tone and helps avoid passive voice by focusing the discussion on the reader. Consider omitting *you can* whenever the sentence works without it.

***Examples:***

  - Create your own unique Lumia experience. 

  - You can set advanced options later if you need them. 

Use first person sparingly.

Use first person (usually *I* or *me*) only when you need to write from the point of view of the customer.

***Example:***  

- Alert me when a new Bluetooth device tries to connect to my computer. (Check box text)

Avoid first-person plural.

First-person plural, which often uses the pronoun *we*, can feel like a daunting corporate presence—the opposite of Microsoft's modern voice. It’s OK to use phrasing like *we recommend* if it helps you avoid awkward phrasing like it’s recommended, but write around it if you can. Try to keep the focus on the customer, not Microsoft.

***Examples:***

  - Select the people you want to give permission to. We'll verify their identities before opening the document. 

  - In September, we took a major step forward in introducing Windows 10 to our enterprise customers. 

  - The scheduled default setting is the easiest way to keep your computer up-to-date. (Instead of *We recommend that you use the scheduled default setting...*)
