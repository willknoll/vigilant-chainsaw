# What's New

## Working remotely during challenging times

**Microsoft FRP providing partner support with assisting customers working remotely**

In response to the global **COVID-19 outbreak,** we've been working closely with our team in China to learn from their experiences and to provide help. One of our colleagues, Lily Zheng, shared some best practices about remote work with her regional customers in the China region; Microsoft CVP Jared Spataro published a [Microsoft 365 blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/02/working-remotely-during-challenging-times) highlighting Lily's story and lessons learned. We hope her findings prove useful.

Companies, schools, and service providers have turned to remote access communications to protect individuals and deter the spread of the COVID-19 virus. To assist organizations in all regions that are unable to support a remote work model Microsoft has set up a free six-month [Microsoft Teams Cloud Service Provider (CSP) trial.](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/partners/news/article/acquire-new-and-upsell-current-customers-with-new-microsoft-teams-trial) This trial was announced to the general public March 3, 2020.

The FastTrack Ready Partner team anticipates that many trial customers will require assistance. We know each of you stand ready with your experience and expertise to help!

It is our hope that we can assist public health and safety by making working remotely easier.
