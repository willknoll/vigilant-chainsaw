# Payment and Statement Processes

When onboarding, access the Microsoft Payment Central Platform (MPC) to learn how to submit:

- **contact information**
- **bank account details**
- **tax information**

To comply with the program rules and policies, and to ensure prompt payment of earned incentives. For details go to [Payment Central Partner Training](https://aka.ms/PaymentCentralPartnerTraining).

Proof of Execution (POE) covers a calendar month reporting period, with payment processing occurring one month in arrears. This allows enough time to validate and process Active Use and other data, ensuring the most accurate reporting and payment process. The Program Management Office (PMO) compiles and posts incentive statements close to the 25th day of the current month, covering the activity in the preceding month, here, https://fasttrackreadysupport.com/.

The following is an example for reference:

|Month        |Previous month AU milestones processed|Statements posted|Payment dispersed|
|:--------------|:-------------- |:---------------|:-------------|
|March 1, 2020  |March 19, 2020  |March 25, 2020  |March 31, 2020|
|April 1, 2020  |April 18, 2020  |April 25, 2020  |April 30, 2020|
