# Incentive Details

The Onboarding and Adoption incentives are designed to help accelerate onboarding and adoption of Microsoft 365 (Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security) workloads through partner engagement. You can earn incentives across multiple eligible workloads within the program period and are paid when you achieve specific usage. 

These are partner incentives and you can use them as you choose, which can include but is not limited to, customer credit for future services, increase overall project margin, offset cost of customer services rendered, customer rebates or sales incentives.

As of July 2019, FastTrack Ready Partners are now subject to two separate sets of Terms & Conditions (Ts&Cs). One for the FRP Program and one for the Online Services Usage (OSU) Incentive program.

The two programs have their own terms and are only loosely connected.

**FRP FY20 Ts&Cs (FY20 FRP Agreement Final October 2019) describe 2 things:**

- FastTrack Benefit customer eligibility and Partner delivery responsibility for the FT Benefit

    - Customer eligibility includes EDU SKUs 
    - There is **no** FT Benefit for AIP/ATP/MCAS, so they are not included in the Ts&Cs

- FastTrack Ready Program incentives that are only available to FRP Partners under these Ts&Cs

    - OLM-AIP – this incentive does not have a 15% milestone, only the 40% as described. 
    - AAD Migration (A310) – this incentive does not have a 15% milestone, only the 10% for 3 apps for 2 months that is described.
    - All other milestone information has been removed because the FRP Program is no longer used to manage or pay the incentives, the terms for all other incentives are owned and managed by CPOR and we do not have any control over them. 
    - CPOR has agreed to pay FRP partners a higher incentive rate to recognize their status and engagement but that is reflected in their terms, not ours. 
    - We have control over who is eligible to be FRP and that is outlined in our terms. 

**Online Services Usage – M365 (FY20 OSU incentive guide) describes 1 thing:**

Online Services Usage incentives for Microsoft 365

- How the program works
- How the incentive model works
- Partner eligibility
- Enrollment
- Incentives 15% & 40% (EXO/SPO/Teams/Yammer/OPP/AADP/AIP/ATP/MCAS/Intune) 

The FRP program and OSU program are linked by the higher incentive values for FRP; that is the only connection. So, the two sets of terms describe each program specifically. **FRP partners get to participate in both.**

With this being the case, EDU is currently out of scope for OSU incentives, so it is not included in the OSU Incentive Guide. EDU is in scope for FastTrack Benefit, so it is included in the FRP Ts&Cs. We will not expect partners to deliver benefits to EDU customers when there is no incentive available; they are free to do so if that is in their overall best business interest.

The OSU Incentive program handles **all** incentives for:

- EXO
- SPO
- OPP
- Teams
- Yammer
- AADP
- AIP
- AATP
- MCAS
- Intune

You can find the rate card [HERE](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/osu-microsoft-365-incentive-resources#/) and it is referenced in the [Incentive Guide](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/osu-microsoft-365-incentive-resources#/) available on the M365 Usage site. As you will see there is an FRP rate and an OSU Competency Partner rate. The Competency Partner rate is the base rate. FRPs are entitled to the FRP rate which is 2X the base or OSU Competency Partner rate.
