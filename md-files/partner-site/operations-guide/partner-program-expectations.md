# Expectations of Partners

When participating in the FastTrack Ready Partner Program, there are some real opportunities for you to showcase your Value-Added Services (VAS). With the program opportunities, also comes expectations for participation, as stated in this section.

## Partner Value-Added Services (VAS)

We encourage partners to market their individual VAS to customers they engage with. VAS are fee-based services that address customer needs outside the scope of the FastTrack Benefits.

- You are free to charge for VAS but should not charge customers for FastTrack Benefit Services you provide.
- If a customer requests services that go beyond the scope of the FastTrack Benefits, you are responsible to advise them of the benefit boundaries.
- Make it clear to customers that VAS are between you and the customer, and are not covered by any Microsoft agreement.
- You will enter into an appropriate services contract with your customers for the provision of VAS.
- Your delivery of FastTrack Benefit Services must comply with the Program Agreement.

## Partner Expectations

Program partners are accountable for assisting eligible customers in onboarding and adopting Qualified Workloads. We strongly encourage you to use the best practices, tools, and IP, but doing so is not a program requirement.

During onboarding and adoption services delivery, Program Partners will:

- Assist eligible customers to configure onboarding tools and processes
- Assist eligible customers to adopt and increase active use of all Qualified Workloads
- Preserve the FastTrack brand reputation and goodwill in the market
- Maintain an average Net Satisfaction (NSAT) score of >80, tracked via program customer surveys (administered by Microsoft once a Qualifying Workload reaches 10% active use)
- Maintain >20% monthly active entitlement use for workloads with >10% active use
- Submit required data as instructed in the [FTOP: Manage Your Customer Data](ftop.md) section of this guide
- Maintain a single point of contact for Program administration
