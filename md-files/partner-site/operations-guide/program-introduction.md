# Introduction to the FastTrack Ready Partner Program

Congratulations on becoming a FastTrack Ready Partner! You're approved to deliver the FastTrack benefit to customers in addition to your value-added services by helping them to deploy and adopt Microsoft 365. This lets you provide customers with a truly customized onboarding experience by leveraging the FastTrack resources and subject matter expertise. In addition, approved partners like you will have access to Microsoft Engineering support, customer referrals, and incentive payments to help reduce cost, drive efficiency, and grow your business. This program offers outcome-based incentives for customers with 150+ seats.
