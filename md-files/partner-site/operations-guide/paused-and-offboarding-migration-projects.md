# Paused and Offboarding Migration Projects

In cases where migration projects have stalled or nothing has proceeded for 30 days or more, the migration environment is shut down and credentials are removed. The migration will then stay at a "paused" state for another 30 days.

In cases where the migration project is already in a paused state for 30 days and there is no confirmed schedule or progress from the customer for another 30 days the MVM will disengage and the migration environment is decommissioned.
