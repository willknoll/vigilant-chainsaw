# Customer Satisfaction Surveys

Microsoft sends a Customer Satisfaction Survey to your customers once a workload achieves the 10% milestone and payment is complete. Survey eligible workloads are: Office 365 (Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, Yammer), Office ProPlus, Intune, Azure Active Directory Premium (AADP) and migration services partners deliver. The objective of the survey is to help Microsoft assess the customers’ satisfaction level and experience with the Partner delivered FastTrack benefit engagement.

The customer survey focuses on:

- Partner responsiveness and expertise
- Ability to explain the FastTrack benefit clearly usefulness of the content provided
- Customer Partner Experience (CPE): Customers’ overall satisfaction with FastTrack engagement
- Net Promoter Score (NPS):  Would the customer recommend FastTrack based on their experience?

Before we can send the survey, we must obtain General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant customer contact information per workload. If the contact details are not properly entered in FTOP, the PSM will work with the partner to collect them. Partners are obligated to provide this <span style="color:red">*</span>information and we request that they do so within a week of the request being made. The GDPR required fields are: Name (First, Last), Email, Country, Survey eligible (y/n), Survey language and Service.

**Action**: In your conversations with those customers that are eligible for a survey, request the customers to do the following:

Check their **Inbox** and **Junk Mail** for their invitation from the *Microsoft FastTrack Center* to complete the survey:

**From:**  survey@userresearch.microsoft.com

**Subject:**  It only takes two minutes

Currently, as a part of a promotion, once the Customer completes the satisfaction survey and clicks submit, they can choose to receive a **$20 Virtual Visa gift card**.

If the customer has not responded to the Customer Satisfaction Survey, Microsoft sends them a reminder 14 days after sending the original survey.
<span style="color:red">*</span>[FastTrack Ready Partner Program Terms and Conditions](http://aka.ms/fasttrackpartnerterms) require that partners input a minimum of one customer contact for each tenant they work with. Partners are also required to maintain an average NSAT Score of >80.
