# Tenant ID Search

Please use the **Tenant ID Search** if you are looking for a milestone you do not have a Line Number for.

**Note:**

You must enter the Tenant ID in the correct character format, for example, 8-4-4-4-12.

If you enter **only** the Tenant ID, you will see **all** milestones in the system related to that Tenant ID. You can click on the Line Number next to each milestone to see more information **or** submit a dispute against that milestone.

- The example below searches for the Tenant ID 0000DEMO-DEMO-DEMO-DEMO-000000000109. The table displays all milestones associated with this Tenant ID. To submit a dispute against one of these milestones, click on the Line Number.

Within the details, you will be able to **select the appropriate reason for disputing this milestone.** You will also be able to provide additional comments for the review team. Once you have **completed the Dispute Reason and Comments, please click Submit** and this dispute will be submitted for review.
