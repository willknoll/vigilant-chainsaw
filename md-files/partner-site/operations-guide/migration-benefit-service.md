# Migration Benefit Service

## FRP Migration Playbook

### Overview

The FastTrack Benefit includes data migration services from qualifying email and file source systems to Office 365.

The Microsoft-staffed FastTrack Center (FT) Migration Team provides the FastTrack data migration services following a well-defined set of rules and policies.

On behalf of your customers, your FastTrack Partner Manager (FPM) will train you to use the FTC Migration Services. You must fully understand the scope and processes of the migration
benefit before offering it to your customer. We want to set the right expectations to optimize customer satisfaction.

FastTrack migration services (as described in the FastTrack Center Benefit for Office 365) are not in scope for this Program and are not part of FastTrack Benefit Services to be
provided by Program Partners.

Partners must acknowledge that any assistance **beyond guidance** is outside the scope of the FastTrack Benefit and the FastTrack Benefit Services. Partners are free to provide the level of service required by
the customer, but

1. Must make it clear to the customer when any requested services go beyond the scope of the FastTrack Benefit to which customer is entitled under their Microsoft 365, Office 365 and/or
EMS purchase, **and**

2. Must enter into an appropriate services contract with customer for the provision of the additional services.

The migration services provided by FastTrack are limited to guidance, tooling, and data moves. All other tasks required for migration, such as scheduling, project management, workstation preparation, etc., are
the responsibility of the customer or their deployment partner. This guide lists the required steps to activate and work with the FTC Migration Service.

The FastTrack MVM and migration team will not perform any changes to the customers source environment, neither will they remove any existing data from the source environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Completion of technical onboarding for the impacted workloads are a prerequisite to migration. For more information about the scope and limits of this service, see the Data Migration service
description.

Please review the [Data Migration Service Description](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/o365-data-migration) to understand what is included and what is not.

The FastTrack Migration team cannot commit to any migration timelines or desired speed due to the large amount of influencing factors and is stated in the FastTrack Data Migration benefit for both mail and
content data migration.
