# Submit a Payment Dispute

This site is designed to make it easy to submit a payment dispute. The first step to submitting a payment dispute is clicking on the button “Add a Dispute” on the right-hand side of the search box.

**Note:**

- If you are disputing a size or any other factor for a milestone that has already been paid, please search for the milestone using the Line Number in the statement. If you do not have a line number, please search for the customer using the Tenant ID. If you do not find the milestone you are looking for, please click submit a new one.
