# Sign in to FTOP Using Your Org ID Credentials

By the onboarding phase of the FastTrack Ready Partner Program you should have established your Partner Center Credentials, which are Microsoft Org ID credentials - your user principal name + password in the format of an e-mail address, e.g. ```johndoe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
or johndoe@contoso.com```

You must have Partner Org ID credentials to access the FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP).
