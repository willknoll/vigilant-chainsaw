- The partner name is displayed above *FRP Payment Disputes.*
- The **user profile** is displayed at the top right of the site.
- You can click on the **pencil icon** to the left of each item to open a pop-up box containing additional information.

### User Profile

The **user profile** will be displayed in the top right-hand side of the site. If you click on your name, your user profile page will appear.

This page will display your company name and selected location. **You will only see the disputed milestones associated with the partner and location chosen.** If you work at a company that has three locations, each will be listed in the drop-down menu under Dispute Location. You will need to select the appropriate location before submitting any dispute milestones.

To return to the **Partner View** (table), please click on the back arrow as there is no button that takes you back to the main page.
