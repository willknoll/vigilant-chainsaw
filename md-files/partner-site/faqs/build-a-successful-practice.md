# Build a Successful Practice

## Resources

**How do I claim my customer workloads to receive incentive payments for my FastTrack services?**

On **October 1, 2019,** the Online Services Usage (OSU) incentive program was discontinued and replaced with new usage incentive programs. This change requires the FRP partners to enroll in OSU M365 program and to claim workloads by associating themselves to the customer and to specific Microsoft 365 services in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard).

**How do I request a technical expert?**

[Subject-matter expert request](https://aka.ms/FRPHubSMERequestProcess). Subject-matter experts (SMEs) are Microsoft staff who have a specific skill set, available upon request, for technical and process support. Approved FastTrack partners may create and submit a request for SME assistance using the [FTC Resource Request page](https://aka.ms/FRPHubFTCResourceRequest). See the Partner [Subject-Matter Expert Request Guide](https://partner-docs.microsoft.com/partner-site/fasttrack-playbook/english-playbook/resources-fasttrack-subject-matter-experts-resources-guidance.html) for step-by-step guidance.

**Where do I manage my customer engagements?**

[FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP)](https://ftop.microsoft.com/dashboard). Through the portal, you can assign and manage FastTrack customers and track workload intention and status. Used by both FastTrack Ready partners and the Microsoft FastTrack Center.

**Where do I go to register my customers with FastTrack?**

[FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP)](https://ftop.microsoft.com/dashboard). Includes best practices, adoption content, FastTrack service descriptions, and an authenticated experience for access to customer-specific information. Updated Process: You can now use the new Customer Registration application for FastTrack Ready Partners. Now there's no longer a need to submit requests for authorization (RFAs)(for informational or updating purposes) in the FastTrack Portal. Learn more with this [Customer Registration Application Video](https://aka.ms/FRPCustomerRegistrationVideo) and reach out to your PSM if you have any questions or [Customer Registration Application Guide](https://aka.ms/FRPHubCollaborationTeamsPartnerCustomerGuide).

Learn more about incentive payments in the FastTrack Ready [Operations Guide](https://partner-docs.microsoft.com/partner-site/operations-guide/index.html).

**How do I maintain program compliance to ensure I receive incentive payments?**

There are several fields of information in the FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP) that approved FastTrack partners must complete to be eligible for incentive payments.

**How many partners are in the program?**

With more than 200 approved partners spanning 45 countries, customers can receive an onboarding experience that combines the benefits provided by FastTrack with unique partner skills, expertise, and locality—without the need to engage multiple teams, partners, and FastTrack resources. In the future, we plan to expand this program to additional partners, in more countries.

**How do I stay up to date on program news and updates?**

The FastTrack Ready Partner group on [Yammer](https://aka.ms/FRPHubResourcesFAQUpToDateYammer) offers real-time updates—and a platform to ask questions and connect with other partners. By joining the group, you will also receive our bi-weekly [Heads Up](https://aka.ms/HeadsUpNewsletter) – a round up of FastTrack Ready news and resources.

Your FastTrack Partner Manager will also invite you to a monthly webinar that covers important program updates, demos, and a chance to ask questions of Microsoft program managers.

**How do I handle GDPR questions related to FastTrack?**

In FastTrack, we collect customer data, such as contact names, email addresses, and phone numbers. If a Microsoft customer asks you to delete or export their FastTrack data, please have them send their request directly to [Microsoft](mailto:O365FTGDPR@microsoft.com). Per the GDPR, we must delete or export PII within 30 days, if a customer requests it.

**I don’t not see any tenants in Portfolio View. What should I do?**

Check the filter that is being used. The *My Active Tenants* filter should be the default view and should show any active tenants that are assigned to you.

If the filter is being used, you may not have any active tenants assigned to you. To see if you have any tenants assigned, try changing to the *My Tenants* view to see if any tenants appear.

If you still do not see any tenants, then you are likely not assigned to any tenants and should reach out to your team manager for assistance.

### Engagement Start Date

**What is the purpose of Engagement Start Date and how will it be used?**

There are three main reasons for collecting this new customer FastTrack (FTC) deployment date:  

- First, it is to qualify new customers by asking specifically when are they ready to engage and meet with the FastTrack Manager (FM) to start the FTC process. By having this date, we can fine-tune our assignment process to better meet customer expectations and avoid the situation where a customer is ready to start but left waiting and getting delayed.  
- The second reason is to improve the work load on each FM for new assignments. By having an understanding of the date customers expect to start, we can better ensure FM assignments are balanced and achievable.  
- The third reason is to better understand serialized deployments and whether a particular customer will continue with new deployment work and whether there will be any gaps between completing one deployment and starting additional deployments. By having Engagement Start Dates per workload for these serialized deployments, a clearer understanding of the demands on the FM for these scenarios can be understood and factored in for new customer assignments.  

**Does the Engagement Start Date apply to all workloads in the tenant?**

The Engagement Start Date applies to all workloads that have an L1 of In Progress only, since those are the workloads the customer intends to deploy. It does not apply to workloads with an L1 of Status Unknown, Blocked or No Intent.  

**Since an Engagement Start Date is a new data field per workload, does an FMss need to go back and populate that date for past or current customer deployments and engagements?**

No, there is no requirement or prompt for the FM to populate this date for past engagements or engagements that are already underway.  

**Is the Engagement Start Date the same as the kick-off meeting date?**

It will depend on the specifics of each customer engagement. For larger customers, typically there would be an initial set of communications prior to the scheduling of the kick-off meeting. The Engagement Start Date should be set to the date when the FM initiated the customer communications specific to the FTC process for this particular workload deployment, which may precede the actual kick-off meeting date. For other customers, if the initial communications is also the same date when the kick-off meeting is completed, then the kick-off date and the engagement start date for that workload may be the same.  

**Is the Engagement Start Date the date the first email is sent to the customer or the date a voicemail is left for the customer?**

No, the purpose of the Engagement Start Date is to document the date that the initial customer and FM communications on the FTC process starts. Therefore, this date should represent the start of the FTC process discussion. Examples of this could be email discussions where the customer is asking questions prior to the kick-off meeting and information is exchanged with the customer by the FM. In other cases, it may be the same as the kick-off meeting, or it could be the date that the FM communicates over the phone with the customer and has the initial discussion to schedule the kick-off meeting. The key action to consider is the date that the customer and  FM starts communication and exchanges information on the FTC process.  

**Can I update and change the Engagement Start Date if a customer re-schedules their first discussion with the FM?**

Yes, engagement start dates can be updated by the FM. A typical scenario would be for new customer assignments. In this case, the Gateway Team would first enter the Engagement Start Date that the customer specifies during the Gateway conversation. However, if the FM attempts to contact the customer and the customer asks for a new date or rescheduled date, the FM should update that Engagement Start Date to reflect this new date to start the FM communications with the customer on the FTC process.  

**As an FM receiving a new customer assignment, how do I handle the case when the customer does not respond back on or by the Engagement Start Date?**

For a new customer, the Engagement Start Date is populated by the Gateway Team. If the FM attempts to communicate with the customer on that date and receives no reply back from the customer, the FM should continue efforts to contact the customer. Once the customer replies and a new date is set to have the initial discussions on the FTC process, the FM should update the Engagement Start Date then to reflect the actual date of this discussion.
In cases where the customer never responds back and becomes inactive or unresponsive, the FM should document the situation in the Overall Status Notes, but not update the Engagement Start Date.

**As an FM if I end up changing and updating the Engagement Start Date, is there a requirement that I enter any notes, and if yes where?**

Yes, anytime the Engagement Start Date is updated, the FM should make a note as to the reason in the Overall Status Notes. Do not use the Entitlement Notes field for this purpose. This will require the FM update the Engagement Start Date in the Services Tab and switch to the Overall Status Notes, which is a different screen to document the reason. It is recognized that this is a suboptimal process currently, and enhancements in this area will continue to be evaluated as part of monthly FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP) user interface (UI) enhancement releases.  

**For current active customers that are deploying a workload, would I ever use the Engagement Start Date?**

Yes, there are two common cases when an FM will update this date for specific workloads:

- The first reason is for customers that have a serialized deployment motion for additional workloads. In this case, the Engagement Start Date should be set to the estimated or planned date that the FM will communicate with the customer to start this additional new workload deployment motion. If the exact date into the future is not known, then estimate to the first day of the month where this next workload deployment is anticipated.
- The second case is for customers with a workload deployment; and as part of the Customer Success Review intent, it is obtained for additional deployments. In this case, the Engagement Start Date should be set for when the FM discussion on those new workload deployment projects are expected to start. This may be the same date as the kick-off meeting date for these additional workloads.  

**Will the FastTrack Ready Partners (FRP) use and update the Engagement Start Date?**

For new customers, since the Gateway Team populates the Engagement Start Date prior to delivery channel assignments, customers that are assigned to an FRP partner will also contain an Engagement Start Date. In this initial release, we do not require FRP partners to update this field; however, it will be evaluated for future use by the FRP program.
