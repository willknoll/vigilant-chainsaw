# FTOP Home Page

## Overview

When you open FTOP, the default **Filter** is set to My Active Tenants, Priority is set to All, and Display is set to Scorecard Adoption. The list of tenants is sorted by highest to lowest (High, Medium, Low) priority. On the left side of the window (often referred to as the left fly-out menu) you have a *FastTrack Guidance* menu. This menu expands to display links (*see FastTrack Guidance menu in this article*).

## FastTrack Guidance Menu

The *FastTrack Guidance menu* is on the left side of FTOP. This menu expands to display links to help and guidance information for FTOP and the FastTrack Center. The menu appears collapsed by default and displays menu item icons.
