# FAQ

## Overview

### No tenants in Portfolio View

**Question**: I donâ€™t not see any tenants in Portfolio View. What should I do?

**Answer**: Check the filter that is being used. The *My Active Tenants* filter should be the default view and should show any active tenants that are assigned to you.

If the filter is being used, you may not have any active tenants assigned to you. To see if you have any tenants assigned, try changing to the *My Tenants* view to see if any tenants appear. 

If you still do not see any tenants, then you are likely not assigned to any tenants and should reach out to your team manager for assistance.
