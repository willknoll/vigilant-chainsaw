## Appendix

### Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)

“Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is Microsoft’s multi-tenant cloud based directory and identity management service. Azure AD also includes a full suite of identity management capabilities including multi-factor authentication, device registration, self-service password management, self-service group management, privileged account management, role based access control, application usage monitoring, rich auditing and security monitoring and alerting.”  Azure AD provides authentication (AuthN) and authorization (AuthZ) functions for Microsoft cloud services in addition to housing partner and customer tenants, domains, users, entitlements, etc.

#### Tenants

A tenant is the Azure AD instantiation of a partner or customer, meaning it is a dedicated instance of Azure AD that an organization receives and owns when it signs up for a Microsoft cloud service such as Azure or Office 365.  Each partner is typically represented by a single partner tenant. Each customer is also represented by a single customer tenant whether created (provisioned) by a partner or directly by Microsoft.

#### FastTrack Ready Partner Onboarding through Partner Center

**Enrollment Process**

Enrolling for an Azure AD tenant as a partner is accomplished by submitting a request form at https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/register/joinnow/enrollmentWelcome/valueaddedreseller.

This process enrolls the partner in Partner Center and enables the partner to set up their marketing profile and it will enable additional Partner Center capabilities in the future.

The below list of representative screenshots walks through the end-to-end enrollment process. The actual user experience may vary somewhat, but it should provide the reader with a good understanding of the end-to-end flow.

- **Step 1:** Navigate to [Partner Center](https://partnercenter.microsoft.com/pcv/register/joinnow/enrollmentWelcome/valueaddedreseller) and click **Next.**
