# Notes History

## Overview

This page provides two separate functions depending on the context of where you access Latest Notes.

- If you access Notes History from the User Interface (UI), it displays notes for the tenants assigned to you. You will make selections from **All, Filter By Note Category, Filter By Services** from the drop-down menus to narrow down the list of notes you are viewing.

The following screen shows latest notes accessed from the Notes Library and not within the context of a tenant.
