# FTOP Partner User Guide

## Overview

## Customer vs. Tenant vs. and Service vs. Workload

As part of the FastTrack Center (FTC), youâ€™ll frequently hear the terms *customer, tenant, service and workload.* In many cases, these terms are used interchangeably, which is not always correct. Providing context to proper usage is important because FTOP (and this guide) uses all 4 terms.

- We use the term **customer** to refer to the school, company, or organization that purchased the Microsoft 365 service(s). We typically refer to a customer by their name (or a form of their name), for example, Contoso, Inc., Maple University, or Microsoft Corporation.

- We use the term **tenant** to refer to the logical grouping of purchased services and the data stored in those services. We refer to a tenant by either the Tenant Name (contoso.onmicrosoft.com) or the Tenant ID (871e613c-59df-73c1-b016-f93aac00dccd).

- We use the terms ***service*** and ***workload*** interchangeably to describe the M365 service(s) (EXO, SPO, OPP, Teams, Yammer, AADP, Intune etc.) the customer has purchased entitlements for from Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> **Screen capture images:** In this guide, we use screen captures of real tenants, employees, and vendors to provide visual examples of FTOP. For privacy reasons, we obscure that data, such as the tenant names and IDs.
