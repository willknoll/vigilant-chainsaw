### Performance Tab

As stated in the FastTrack Ready Partner **Terms & Conditions,** partners must meet the performance requirements for the duration of their participation in the Program. One of the requirements is to meet the one of the following performance workload benchmarks:

- Teamwork Eligibility: 2,500 AE Growth in Trailing Twelve Months on 3 of the 4 Teamwork workloads (Exchange, SharePoint, Teams, Yammer)
- Security Eligibility: 2,500 AE Growth in Trailing Twelve Months on both Intune and AADP workloads
- Get Modern Eligibility: 5,000 MAU Growth in trailing twelve months on Office 365 ProPlus 

We have launched a new report in the FRP Dashboard which will help you to track/monitor the above performance metrics. For more information, use the FRP Dashboard Overview Slides or listen in to the [February Partner Call recording.](https://m365elite.eventbuilder.com/event/7885)
