# Draft Notes

When you are in the Notes Editor, you have the option to **save drafts.** Ten drafts may be saved to be reviewed at a later time. You can expand or hide the details of your draft using the up/down arrows, and you will be asked to confirm your deletion. To continue to work on a draft, click restore draft. A scenario where this tool is beneficial is, if you draft while on a call, save draft, then you can restore it later to finalize your draft, then save it and it will be associated with a tenant latest notes.
