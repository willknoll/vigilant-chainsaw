### Four easy steps to onboarding

An experience guided by the FastTrack team:

- Setup your payment profile
- Associate customers in Partner Center
- Configure access to FastTrack tools and reporting
- Get to know your FastTrack Partner Manager (FPM)

### Set up your payment profile

Starting in October 2019, all OSU M365 workload incentives will be paid through the OSU program. To receive payments for servicing these OSU qualifying workloads, the partner must enroll through the Partner Center.  Workloads not in the OSU program will continue to be supported through Payment Central Process described below.

**Enroll in Partner Center for the Online Services Usage**

Your organization will need to complete enrollment via Partner Center. To help accelerate your transition, we are opening program enrollment in the early September 2019 time frame. This will ensure you maintain business continuity for associating customers and earning incentives.

Enrollment is a one-time step required for each partner location where payments will be paid.  Each location MPN ID that is enrolled will be associated with a bank and tax profile.  This MPN ID can be found in the Onboarding RM field in FTOP.  

For a step-by-step walk through please refer to this [guide](https://aka.ms/osuenrollmentguide).

**Set up your Payment Central Profile**

To receive FastTrack Ready program incentives, you must set up a Microsoft Payment Central Profile. Your profile helps ensure we have the most up-to-date banking and tax information, so we can accurately remit payment.

Here’s how to set up your profile:

- Provide your organization’s contact information.
- Complete a short compliance questionnaire.
- Provide tax information.
- Provide your organization’s banking information.

The Microsoft [Payment Central Process Overview](https://aka.ms/FRPHumbPaymentCentralOnboardingInstructions) can help you prepare for any additional information needed for setup.

### Associate customers in Partner Center

With the move to Partner Center, partners will have a new way to associate themselves to customers they’re helping rollout Microsoft 365 services.  This removes the need to become the Digital Partner of Record or create an association via FTOP to gain active usage credit or earn incentives.  With this new customer association experience, partners can associate themselves not only to the customer, but to specific Microsoft 365 service(s). Like the prior FastTrack Ready registration process, there will be 4 pieces of information needed to create a customer association:

- Customer tenant details to identity the customer you are actively engaged with
- Customer contact details of the individual you are working with at the customer
- Claim details to specify the MPN ID indicating the location where incentive payments will be paid
- Selection of the services in scope for your engagement and proof of engagement documentation

A step-by-step walk through for Partner Center Customer Claims refer to this guide.

For more information on the Online Services Usage (OSU) Incentives please refer to this [guide.](https://aka.ms/osuenrollmentguide)

### FastTrack Ready Partner Payment Disputes Site

OSU M365 workload incentives will be paid through the OSU program.  To resolve disputes of payments for the OSU M365 incentives can request assistance through the [OSU Support site](mspartner.microsoft.com).   FRP incentives not in the OSU M365 program will continue to be supported through Payment Central Process described below.

For FRP related workloads not supported by OSU M365 program, submit your inquiry  directly to the FastTrack Ready Partner [payment disputes site](https://fasttrackreadysupport.com/) if you notice a discrepancy between your records and the proof of execution (POE) statement. Note that dispute inquiries will continue to be accepted through the Excel method until March 31, 2019.

### Configure access to FastTrack tools and reporting

Through the [FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP)](https://ftop.microsoft.com/dashboard), your team can manage customer engagements, share experiences, and access reporting.

For security purposes, users granted the appropriate Partner Center role use their Org ID for authentication. Your partner tenant will need to be approved and your users granted the appropriate permissions to gain access.

### Get to know your FastTrack Partner Manager (FPM)

- Support day-to day activities (for example, provide helpful resources, answer program questions).
- Help your teams to understand the program.
- Provide guidance on how to best leverage the program with your customers.

You’ll also have access to a team of subject-matter experts who are available to help you with complex technical scenarios.
