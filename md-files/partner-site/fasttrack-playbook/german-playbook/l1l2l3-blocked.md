## [L2 - Customer IT Infrastructure and Remediation](l1l2l3-blocked-customer-it-infrastructure-remediation.md)
Dependencies with surrounding IT infrastructure components in a customer's environment (e.g., virtual private network (VPN) devices not compatible, hardware updates, Active Directory (AD) complexities,hybrid scenarios, Client, browser, etc.) block adoption.
For this L2, the problem must be related to a Technology. It is NOT related to people or processes.
 
## [L2 - IT Change Management and Resourcing](l1l2l3-blocked-it-change-management-resourcing.md)
Service maintenance or updates are causing existing Customer IT processes and policies (e.g., IT process, monitoring, incident handling, issue discovery, home use policy, etc.) to break, which blocks adoption. This solution requires process or policy redesign to manage the change. Customer may be blocked by lack of resourcing (budget/people) to remediate.
For this L2, the problem must be related to the Technical Administrators or IT teams. It is NOT directly related to the underlying technology, user readiness, or business rules.

## [L2 - Adoption Readiness](l1l2l3-blocked-adoption-readiness.md)
Customer is blocked from adopting the service due to issues with internal change management, including end user readiness or business processes. Do not use this for IT change management issues.

Core Product/Service features and functionality (including security/privacy settings, features and certifications) are missing or contain bugs. Resolved primarily through GetHelp or OneList.
