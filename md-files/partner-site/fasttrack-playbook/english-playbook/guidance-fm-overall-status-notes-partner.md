# Overall Status Notes Guidance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to track and monitor all M365 customers requesting deployment assistance or accelerating deployment plans due to COVID-19 all notes should include hashtag **#covid**. In addition we have issued the following Notes guidance:  
>
>For customers who express a need to **pause or stop deployment, do not add #covid** and instead update Entitlement Status (L1/L2/L3) to reflect this change.  

>**Role:** FastTrack Manager  
>**Action required:** Update **Engagement Management** and/or **Service Intent** notes for customers that have accelerated their deployment/adoption priorities due to COVID19. **Include hashtag #covid**  

>**Role:** FE/SME/GMFTA/MVM

Guidance is being communicated to ensure that we are following a consistent process across all regions. This will improve predictability and reduce confusion regarding which notes go where and how often they need to be recorded.

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Applies To: **All Services**

## Objectives
There are two notes types, which should be used by the FM roles: **Overall Status Notes** and [Entitlement Status Notes](status-guidance-entitlement-status-notes.md). This guidance details the expectations placed on the FMs (and certain SME teams) pertaining to the frequency, the location, and the Overall Status Note's content and format.


## Frequency
Overall Status Notes should be used for all **non-workload specific** technical updates, customer or account team relationship insights and meeting/workshops delivered or scheduled, as well as project management or resource issues impacting the ability of the customer to make progress as planned. They should include detail on the Next Action, Date, and Owner of the next action. Overall Status Notes should also be used for more formal *Exec Summary* updates on engagements. These updates provide the FastTrack Leadership Team (LT) and RM with a snapshot of current key information relating to the customer. 

## Normal Customer Lifecycle Notes - Notes Content and Format
These updates should be added after a call with the customer/account team/partner where there is information of a note that is worth tracking because it helps document the customer journey through FastTrack, helps management understand and assess progress, and documents next actions. Examples are as follows:
 -  The Customer has just received approval for Office 365 (O365) Express Route. The Partner has engaged to assist with deployment, which is anticipated to be in place by the end of May 2019. Doing so will unblock the deployment of multiple workloads due to current network capacity issues. 
 -  The Account team has a full day "art of the possible" workshop planned in April 2019 to walk the customer through the capabilities of Exchange Online, Teams, Office 365 ProPlus (OPP) and Yammer. An  overview will be presented of FastTrack for 30 minutes at the end of the workshop to introduce the scope and limitations of our service offering. 

An **Adoption SME** should continue to use **Overall Status Notes** for their updates as they do currently. 

## Exec Summary Notes- Notes Content and Format
With this guidance, we are introducing the concept of an "Exec Summary" as a specially-formatted note in the Overall Status Notes field. Exec Summary updates will be provided by FMs upon request from an RM. The FM can also choose to include an Exec Summary update when they feel it is appropriate for High or Medium priority customers and if there is significant change since the last update. There are no mandatory timeframes for an FM to provide these updates. Any escalations or issues should be referenced (called out) in the Risks box.
