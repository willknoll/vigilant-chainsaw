# Initiate Phase

The Initiate Phase identifies how to conduct a kickoff meeting to discuss the onboarding process, verify data, and gain an understanding of how the customer plans to use services, as well as their goals and plans to drive usage. The kickoff discussion addresses any knowledge gaps and customer's overall technical needs, business goals, and expectations, while delivering the M365 value proposition.

Primary goals are as follows:

-   Set expectations around services the customer wants and needs.

-   Identify customer gaps in understanding product benefits and status of
    adoption prerequisites.

-   Encourage the customer to participate in business value workshops or
    follow-up discussions for more details on our services and products.

-   Establish a regular communication rhythm with the customer and agree on an approach for moving forward.

The processes within this phase include:

- [Conduct Customer KickOff](initiate-conduct-customer-kick-off-partner.md)
- [Deploy Securely](initiate-deploy-securely-partner.md)
- [Setup Governance Review Meeting Cadence](initiate-review-meeting-cadence-partner.md)
