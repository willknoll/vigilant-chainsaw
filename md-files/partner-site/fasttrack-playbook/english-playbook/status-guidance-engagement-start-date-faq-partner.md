# Engagement Start Date Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Question:** What is the purpose of Engagement Start Date and how will it be used?

**Answer:** There are three main reasons for collecting this new customer FastTrack (FTC) deployment date:

- First, it is to qualify new customers by asking specifically when are they ready to engage and meet with the FastTrack Manager (FM) to start the FTC process. By having this date, we can fine-tune our assignment process to better meet customer expectations and avoid the situation where a customer is ready to start but left waiting and getting delayed.  
- The second reason is to improve the work load on each FM for new assignments. By having an understanding of the date customers expect to start, we can better ensure FM assignments are balanced and achievable.  
- The third reason is to better understand serialized deployments and whether a particular customer will continue with new deployment work and whether there will be any gaps between completing one deployment and starting additional deployments. By having Engagement Start Dates per workload for these serialized deployments, a clearer understanding of the demands on the FM for these scenarios can be understood and factored in for new customer assignments.  

**Q:** Does the Engagement Start Date apply to all workloads in the tenant?\

**A:** The Engagement Start Date applies to all workloads that have an L1 of In Progress only, since those are the workloads the customer intends to deploy. It does not apply to workloads with an L1 of Status Unknown, Blocked or No Intent.  

**Q:** Since an Engagement Start Date is a new data field per workload, does an FMss need to go back and populate that date for past or current customer deployments and engagements?\

**A:** No, there is no requirement or prompt for the FM to populate this date for past engagements or engagements that are already underway.  

**Q:** Is the Engagement Start Date the same as the kickoff meeting date?  

**A:** It will depend on the specifics of each customer engagement. For larger customers, typically there would be an initial set of communications prior to the scheduling of the kickoff meeting. The Engagement Start Date should be set to the date when the FM initiated the customer communications specific to the FTC process for this particular workload deployment, which may precede the actual kickoff meeting date. For other customers, if the initial communications is also the same date when the kickoff meeting is completed, then the kickoff date and the engagement start date for that workload may be the same.  

**Q:** Is the Engagement Start Date the date the first email is sent to the customer or the date a voicemail is left for the customer?  

**A:** No, the purpose of the Engagement Start Date is to document the date that the initial customer and FM communications on the FTC process starts. Therefore, this date should represent the start of the FTC process discussion. Examples of this could be email discussions where the customer is asking questions prior to the kickoff meeting and information is exchanged with the customer by the FM. In other cases, it may be the same as the kickoff meeting, or it could be the date that the FM communicates over the phone with the customer and has the initial discussion to schedule the kickoff meeting. The key action to consider is the date that the customer and  FM starts communication and exchanges information on the FTC process.  

**Q:** Can I update and change the Engagement Start Date if a customer re-schedules their first discussion with the FM?  

**A:** Yes, engagement start dates can be updated by the FM. A typical scenario would be for new customer assignments. In this case, the Gateway Team would first enter the Engagement Start Date that the customer specifies during the Gateway conversation. However, if the FM attempts to contact the customer and the customer asks for a new date or rescheduled date, the FM should update that Engagement Start Date to reflect this new date to start the FM communications with the customer on the FTC process.  

**Q:** As an FM receiving a new customer assignment, how do I handle the case when the customer does not respond back on or by the Engagement Start Date?

**A:** For a new customer, the Engagement Start Date is populated by the Gateway Team. If the FM attempts to communicate with the customer on that date and receives no reply back from the customer, the FM should continue efforts to contact the customer. Once the customer replies and a new date is set to have the initial discussions on the FTC process, the FM should update the Engagement Start Date then to reflect the actual date of this discussion. 
In cases where the customer never responds back and becomes inactive or unresponsive, the FM should document the situation in the Overall Status Notes, but not update the Engagement Start Date.  

**Q:** As an FM if I end up changing and updating the Engagement Start Dat", is there a requirement that I enter any notes, and if yes where?  

**A:** Yes, anytime the Engagement Start Date is updated, the FM should make a note as to the reason in the Overall Status Notes. Do not use the Entitlement Notes field for this purpose. This will require the FM update the Engagement Start Date in the Services Tab and switch to the Overall Status Notes, which is a different screen to document the reason. It is recognized that this is a suboptimal process currently, and enhancements in this area will continue to be evaluated as part of monthly FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP) user interface (UI) enhancement releases.  

**Q:** For current active customers that are deploying a workload, would I ever use the Engagement Start Date?  

**A:** Yes, there are two common cases when an FM will update this date for specific workloads:

- The first reason is for customers that have a serialized deployment motion for additional workloads. In this case, the Engagement Start Date should be set to the estimated or planned date that the FM will communicate with the customer to start this additional new workload deployment motion. If the exact date into the future is not known, then estimate to the first day of the month where this next workload deployment is anticipated.
- The second case is for customers with a workload deployment; and as part of the Customer Success Review intent, it is obtained for additional deployments. In this case, the Engagement Start Date should be set for when the FM discussion on those new workload deployment projects are expected to start. This may be the same date as the kickoff meeting date for these additional workloads.  

**Q:** Will the FastTrack Ready Partners (FRP) use and update the Engagement Start Date?  

**A:** For new customers, since the Gateway Team populates the Engagement Start Date prior to delivery channel assignments, customers that are assigned to an FRP partner will also contain an Engagement Start Date. In this initial release, we do not require FRP partners to update this field; however, it will be evaluated for future use by the FRP program.
