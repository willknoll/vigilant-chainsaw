# Security and Compliance

## Overview

The Security and Compliance Approach is the way by which the Priorities for Intune, Azure Active Directory Premium (AADP), Cloud Managed Monthly Active Devices (MAD) and Security & Compliance E5 will be delivered. It describes the FastTrack scale way to deliver on Intune, AADP and MAD. In FY20, it will also be the approach to deliver on the Microsoft 365 E5 Security and Compliance workloads to be incubated.

## Objectives

1. Understand customer Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) and Security & Compliance deployment requirements and how Microsoft 365 security solutions address them.
2. Assess customer's current knowledge of Identity, Device and Information security.
3. Explain to the customer:

   - Importance of security.
   - Why a security baseline should be established.
   - Why productivity and collaboration workloads should deploy securely.

4. Route the customer to the appropriate resources to enable value (active usage/devices) quickly.
5. Guide customer through a secure deployment.

## Approach

Primary Roles: **FastTrack Manager, FastTrack Engineer, EMS SME, ATP SME**

The Security & Compliance Approach will be run through the Customer Health, Targeting and RFA motions.

The Customer will follow Assess, Remediate and Enablement steps across the applicable workloads intended to deploy. Within the FastTrack, these workloads include AADP, Intune, Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection (OATP), Azure Information Protection (AIP), and Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (MDATP).  Remaining Security & Compliance workloads (Azure Advanced Threat Protection (AATP), Microsoft Cloud App Security (MCAS), Microsoft Information Protection (MIP), Microsoft Information Governance (MIG)), will be supported via specialized SME resources in the Customer Experience Engineering (CXE) team in FY20.

### Request Subject Matter Expert for Security and Compliance

To get support for your customer on Security and Compliance workloads in FY20, here are directions to request a resource, which will follow a routing model that provides resources across FastTrack, Get To Production (GTP), Incubation, and Self-Help.  

To request resources for the Security and Compliance workloads: AADP, OATP, MDATP, AIP, MCAS, AATP, and MIG, request [SME support](https://aka.ms/frpsmerequest):

**A few considerations for your request:**

- If your customer needs assistance on multiple workloads, create a request for each workload separately. Provide as much detail as possible in the request form for improved routing and speed to engagement.  
- Workloads that are still in Incubation predominantly have English speaking resource coverage, but we continue to build out support for additional languages, so if uncertain, please submit a request for language of need and the routing model triage will determine if we have support or not. 
- Identity SME request process does not change. Continue to request Identity SMEs, if you need assistance on ensuring customers are educated and understand identity constructs.
