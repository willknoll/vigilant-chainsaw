# Conduct Success Review

Phase: **Success**

## Overview

The Conduct Success Review process is a formal check-in with a customer who reaches the minimum 10% active usage (AU) target for all intended workloads or achieves their customer-defined success metrics to discuss
achievements to date, next steps and activities to accomplish them, and understand whether the customer wants to evaluate new business scenarios. If a customer is not interested in expanding scope, this review is designed to educate customers to maintain usage momentum, introduce new training resources, and engage more broadly with the Microsoft customer community.

## Objectives

Establish customer intent:

  - For new workloads, identify gaps in customer understanding of product benefits, driving usage, and establishing the status of Adoption pre-requisites for new workloads; and identify an approach to address gaps with customer.
  - To sustain current usage, educate customers on best practices to maintain momentum for services deployed and help establish a plan to sustain successful consumption including how to:
      - Create a self-serve support function within the customer organization.
      - Build a champions community (if not in place).
      - Track and manage progress.
      - Determine where to locate training resources.
  - Set FastTrack engagement expectations with customer if the workload service usage is at or greater than 10% and customer does not want to use additional FastTrack services.

## Approach

### Conduct Customer Success Review Meeting

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Conduct customer success review meeting:

  - Set expectations with the customer about post-FastTrack experience when the customer does not want additional services and has plans in place to sustain momentum.
  - Support level is reduced because the customer is doing well, making progress, and can manage on their own. Use one of the following decks and customize slides to structure the conversation:
      - [Success Review deck](https://aka.ms/success-workshop-decks-all)
      - [Guidance: Success Review deck](https://aka.ms/guidance-success-review-deck)

Mark the conduct success review meeting task complete after meeting is conducted, then complete the overall status if the meeting results in any of the following outcomes:

  - Customer agrees to continue to engage FastTrack through additional business value discussions (BVD).
  - Customer agrees to enable additional workload entitlements through FastTrack.
  - Customer agrees to transition ongoing usage and adoption activities to the Customer Success Manager (CSM) for Enterprise Enhanced Adoption service​.
  - Customer chooses to disengage from FastTrack for future deployment activities.
