# Request FastTrack Subject Matter Expert (SME) Resources

## Determining Required SME Role

A key benefit for FastTrack Ready Partners is the availability of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) to provide deep technical and/or deployment guidance to the **FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP)** and Customer. Subject Matter Experts have demonstrated expert levels of knowledge in specific workload, core, or security and compliance areas.

The FRP may request a SME and the FastTrack Partner Manager (FPM) (formerly known as Partner Success Manager (PSM)) is responsible for approving requests. Once the request is approved, a SME will be assigned. The SME will work with the FRP rather than with the customer in most scenarios.

A SME can be requested through the [FTC Resource Request page](https://aka.ms/frpsmerequest) and can include the following roles:

- **FastTrack Engineer SME:** assists on any FRP workloads  

- **FastTrack Migration Resource:** available to respond to Exchange migration questions  

An FRP works with their FPM to determine the role requirements and expectations prior to submitting the request.

Below are some additional details for requesting **Security & Compliance SME** Requests:

## Proactive SME assignment by Microsoft to Partners

In certain circumstances, a SME will be assigned proactively by Microsoft with agreement with an FRP; it is done with the goal of upskilling a partner by coaching them through customer engagements. These engagements are set for a specific period, with agreed upon outcomes. 

## SME Request Denials

Please discuss any questions you may have with the FPM before submitting the request to avoid denials based on issues listed below:  

- If you do not fill out the *Additional Information* section, there may not be enough information to approve it.

- If you request SME assistance for the same topic for multiple customers.  

## Onboarding a SME  

Once a SME is assigned by Microsoft, the requestor will receive notification with onboarding steps. A SME may reach out directly. It is expected that the FRP will participate with the FPM & SME to clearly set expectations, outcomes, exit criteria and timelines (for example: customer-facing guidance, FE shadowing, FTOP task execution), and any pertinent criteria to release the SME once the activities are complete.

## Accountabilities and Expectations during SME Engagement  

The following are the roles and responsibilities of an engagement with a SME.

## FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP)

- Contact the FPM **first** and keep them in the loop.

- Once a SME is assigned, the FRP will receive notification with the next steps.  

- Participate with the FPM & SME to clearly set expectations, outcomes, exit criteria and timelines (customer-facing guidance, FE shadowing, FTOP task execution, etc.), and any pertinent criteria to release the SME once the activities are complete. 

- Once a SME closes the engagement, FRPs do not reach out to them directly for any new or existing issues without consulting the FPM.

- Take accountability for learning from SMEs to upskill resources on every engagement and to train additional resources at the Partner on the subject matter.

- Minimize requesting SMEs for similar scenarios, except for data migration.

## FastTrack Partner Manager (FPM)

- The FPM will handle issues, concerns, and escalations related to the SME request.

- Review and approve or deny SME requests.

- Ensure commitment from the partner to assign specific resources towards learnings from the engagement.

- Collaborate with the SME and Partner to clearly set expectations, outcomes, exit criteria and timelines between Customer, SME, and Partner.

- Hold Partners accountable for learning from each engagement by ensuring their active participation.

- Monitor that SME **requests are not made** for similar scenarios repeatedly.

## Subject Matter Expert (SME)

- Collaborate with the Partner and FPM to support the customer. There may be circumstances where the SME works directly with the customer, with the partner in a supporting role.

- Follow the FastTrack Service description and enable the partner to deliver to the Service Description.

- Update information via the FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP) to give a summary to the FPM and partner upon completion of service.

- SMEs to capture feedback about the engagement and share it with the FPM. The FPM is listed in FTOP.
