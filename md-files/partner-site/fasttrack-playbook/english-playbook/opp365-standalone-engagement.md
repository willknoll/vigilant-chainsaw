# Office 365 ProPlus Standalone Engagement

## Overview

The primary driver of Office 365 ProPlus MAU in FY20 will be the Get Modern motion, which includes both Windows 7/8.1 to Windows 10 upgrade & Office 365 ProPlus deployment using System Center. Please reference the Get Modern Scale Playbook for additional information.

This playbook is designed for FastTrack Engineers, with support from FastTrack Managers & OPP SMEs, to guide customers through deployment of Office 365 ProPlus without Windows upgrade.

## Objectives

The following is a list of objectives for this playbook:

- Ensuring customers deploy and use the latest cloud connected Office client applications in organizations is critical as we continue to support our customers as they prepare for Office 2010 end of support and through their digital transformation journey.

- Office 365 ProPlus is of strategic importance to Microsoft among competition as we shift our customers to the cloud with Microsoft 365.

## Approach

**Primary Role: FastTrack Engineer Applies To: Office 365 ProPlus (without Windows 10 upgrade)**

At any time should your engagement become delayed, blocked or you otherwise require additional support executing this playbook, request an OPP SME using the [FastTrack Resource Request Tool](https://aka.ms/FRPHubSMERequestProcess). This team of dedicated OPP subject matter experts are available to support the at scale motion but at no time do they replace the role of the FastTrack Manager, Engineer or Architect.

**1. Office 365 ProPlus Technical Assessment & Planning**

- The assessment workshop guides the customer to discover and plan the Office 365 ProPlus deployment. During the workshop it will inform the important decision points for the Office 365 ProPlus deployment. The workshop provides the discussion to identify decision points for the customers. Use the assessment [workshop deck](https://ftdocs-bcm.azureedge.net/public/en-us-o365-proplus-assessment-workshop-v1.pptx). Delivery of the workshop should include the IT team responsible for the Office 365 ProPlus deployment. Customers can be directed to the Office Deployment Guide and uses a consistent structure for further supporting resources.

**2. Create Remediation Checklist**

- Use the Remediation Questionnaire and Checklist to provide the customer with deployment guidance for any/all FTC supported services. The GCC High/DOD version should be used for GCC High/DOD customers. To ensure you have the latest content, download a new copy each time. To generate a final checklist, start by filling out the questionnaire (tab) for the appropriate service(s), Guidance for services that are not in scope will be hidden in the final checklist. In order to track usage, please email a completed copy of the XLS to [Microsoft](d4cf4a2d.microsoft.com@amer.teams.ms).

**3. Confirm the customer reviews & resolved anything in the remediation checklist**

**4. Deploy Office 365 ProPlus**

- In the deploy phase use the results of the assessment to guide the customer to build the identified packages and prepare these packages for delivery.

- Guide the customer to build the package configuration file using the [Office Configuration Tool](https://config.office.com) or through the Office 365 client option if the customer will be deploying the package with Configuration Manager. The settings for configuration will be available from the decisions made in the assessment activities, including update channel, languages, etc.

- After the packages are built FastTrack now provides guidance as the customer begins deploying the packages to the targeted groups of users. The customer is responsible for delivering the packages in their selected deployment tooling. FastTrack can provide guidance to assist in this activity.

- FastTrack will continue tracking deployment and use progress together with the customer in follow-on sessions to help ensure the customer continues the roll-out.

- It is not recommended to use the deployment wizard to facilitate this activity.
