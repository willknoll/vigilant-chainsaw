# FM Notes Guidance

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to track and monitor all M365 customers requesting deployment assistance or accelerating deployment plans due to COVID-19 all notes should include hashtag **#covid**. In addition we have issued the following Notes guidance:  
>
>For customers who express a need to **pause or stop deployment, do not add #covid** and instead update Entitlement Status (L1/L2/L3) to reflect this change.  

>**Role:** FastTrack Manager  
>**Action required:** Update **Engagement Management** and/or **Service Intent** notes for customers that have accelerated their deployment/adoption priorities due to COVID19. **Include hashtag #covid**  

>**Role:** FE/SME/GMFTA/MVM  
>**Action required:** Update **Technical Enablement** notes for customers that have accelerated their deployment/migration/adoption priorities due to COVID19. **Include hashtag #covid**  

>**Role:** FastTrack Architect

>**Role:** Gateway Manager  
>**Action required:** Update **Engagement Management** when we have identified customers who want to accelerate a service deployment due to COVID19. **Include hashtag #covid**

Guidance is being communicated to ensure that we are following a consistent process across all regions. This will improve predictability and reduce confusion regarding which notes go where and how often they need to be recorded.

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Applies To: **All Services**

## Objectives

There are two notes types, which should be used by the FM roles: Overall Status Notes and Entitlement Status Notes. This guidance details the expectations placed on the FMs (and certain SME teams) pertaining to the frequency, the location, and the note's content and format.

## [Overall Status Notes](guidance-fm-overall-status-notes-partner.md)

Overall Status Notes should be used for all non-workload specific technical updates, customer or account team relationship insights and meeting/workshops delivered or scheduled, as well as project management or resource issues impacting the ability of the customer to make progress as planned. They should include detail on the Next Action, Date, and Owner of the next action. [Overall Status Notes](guidance-fm-overall-status-notes.md) should also be used for more formal Exec Summary updates on engagements. These updates provide the FastTrack Leadership Team (LT) and RM with a snapshot of current key information relating to the customer.

## [Entitlement Status Notes](status-guidance-entitlement-status-notes-partner.md)

Entitlement Status Notes should be used by each FM (and certain SME teams) to provide a current picture of the entitlements in each workload, per the guidance in the [Entitlement Status Notes Guidance](status-guidance-entitlement-status-notes.md). Updates should be provided when there is a change in the L1 status that needs the associated note for additional context and clarification.
