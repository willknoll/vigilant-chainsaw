# Product / Feature Capability

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Definition:** Core Product/Service features and functionality (including security/privacy settings, features and certifications) are missing or contain bugs. Resolved primarily through GetHelp or OneList.

## Valid Example Scenarios:

| Valid Example Scenario | Scenario Status |
| :--: | :--: |
| Customer cannot deploy until feature X (e.g., Multi-Geo) is added. | Product / Feature Capability |
| Customer cannot deploy until service has specific feature added to meet compliance needs. | Product / Feature Capability |
| Customer is not moving to OD4B because they are on Windows 7 and not able to move to Windows 10 yet, because the new sync client does not support Windows 7. | Product / Feature Capability |
| Customer needs Microsoft Online Product to perform specific function which is currently unavailable. | Product / Feature Capability |

## Invalid Example Scenarios for this L2:

| Invalid Example Scenario | Scenario Status |
| :--: | :--: |
| If an existing application Line of Business (LOB), third party or add-in needs to work (usually Office Pro-Plus (OPP) and SharePoiont Online (SPO), and is not able to. | App Compatibility |
| Service does not work with specific hardware architecture currently in place | Customer IT Infrastructure, Remediation |
| Customer has concerns that product is not mature enough and may not work well in organization. | Service Reliability |

> [!TIP]
> If you are still unsure about using this L2, here are some questions to ask the customer to confirm if this is the appropriate L2 to be used:
>    1. What are the customer requirements for functionality?
>        a. How does not having this functionality
>        b. What competitive advantage can they gain with this feature?
>       c. Is the feature available in competitive products?
>    2. Has this issue been added to OneList?
>    3. Have you received any feedback from the Program Group (PG) or via GetHelp?
>    4. Is it a security issue holding back the onboarding?
>    5. What is being used currently? Is there a workaround in place?
>    6. ​Are competitive products in use now? What do you like/dislike about that particular product that the Microsoft equivalent does not have?​
