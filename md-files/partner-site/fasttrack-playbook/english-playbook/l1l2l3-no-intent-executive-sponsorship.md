# Executive Sponsorship

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Definition:** Lack of awareness, conviction or sponsorship at the decision-making levels in the company to move to the cloud, or to prioritize implementation and usage. Customer may also lack intent due to business decision or reorganization. Selling of business value is needed.

> [!TIP]
> If you are still unsure about using this L2, here are some questions to ask the customer to confirm if this is the appropriate L2 to be used:
>    1. ​Are there unexpected costs for enabling the workload?
>    2. Does the customer see value in the workload?
>    3. Are there any business drivers that could help the customer understand the business value?
>    4. Has a business stakeholder been identified?​
