Guidance is being communicated to ensure that we are following a consistent process across all regions. This will improve predictability and reduce confusion regarding which notes go where and how often they need to be recorded.

In FY20, the following notes types will be deprecated. Therefore, it is suggested that teams using these notes instead adopt the note types in this guidance. 

 -  Customer Sat Notes
 -  Service Status Notes
 -  Technical Notes

High-level note recording expectations on the frequency, location and content of a note by role are as follows:

 -  FastTrack Manager (FM) roles will continue to utilize *Overall Status Notes* for all non-workload specific technical updates, customer or Account team relationship insights and details of meetings delivered or scheduled for future use. These updates will be entered when the FM feels it is appropriate (e.g., after a call with the customer or Account team). Each FM will utilize the *Overall Status Notes* field for engagement Executive (Exec) Summary updates when requested by a Regional Manager (RM). 
 -  An Adoption subject matter experts (SME) will use *Overall Status Notes* for their updates.
 -  The FM (and certain SME teams) will continue to utilize *Entitlement Status Notes*, per the guidance in [Entitlement Status Note Guidance](status-guidance-entitlement-status-notes-partner.md) to provide a current description of **intent** for the entitlements in each workload. Updates should be provided as needed so that the workload entitlements have a clear and up to date description that accurately reflects workload intent.
 -  The FastTrack Engineer (FE)/SME roles will now utilize the workload-specific *Service Time Entry* (time) tasks to record notes and capture the engagement status each time an FE/SME has an interaction with a customer, internal stakeholder, or undertakes an engagement related activity.
 -  FastTrack Architect (FTA) roles will utilize the *Enterprise Notes* for their respective updates.
