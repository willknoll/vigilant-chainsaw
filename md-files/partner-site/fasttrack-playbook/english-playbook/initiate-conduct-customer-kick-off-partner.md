# Conduct Customer Kickoff

Phase: **Initiate**

## Overview

The Conduct Customer Kickoff process initiates the working relationship between the FastTrack Center (FTC) and the customer with conversations that focus on learning what the customer does, discussing what services they own that may be helpful, and setting expectations around how the FTC can support them.

## Objectives

- Listen to the customer's needs, to services they want to deploy and set expectations around FastTrack Benefit.
- Understand customer short vs. long term objectives and align to delivery timeline. 
- Identify customer's current knowledge gaps in understanding product benefits and status of Adoption pre-requisites.
- When a partner is involved, determine scope between FastTrack Manager (FM) and partner.
- If customer wants to combine Kickoff and Technical Assessment discussions, review Deployment Enablement Plan.

## Approach

### Prepare for Kickoff Meeting

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

FM asks questions specific to the customer's concerns/needs to achieve
overall meeting objectives to fully:

- Understand the customer's context and background, licenses owned and activity to date from FTOP.  
- Complete required handover between Gateway Targeting Team and Delivery FM before reaching out to the customer. 
- Conduct background research on the customer, leverage resources such as LinkedIn and the customer's website to gain a general understanding of the customer's industry and core business. Leverage the Account Team where account is managed.  
- If the engagement originates through a Requests for Assistance (RFA),  
  - Set the right expectations around the FastTrack​ Benefit and completion of a workload or service.  
  - FM will disengage from the engagement once it is complete.  
    - Disengagement occurs upon completion of enablement or migration if required.  
      - Definition of enablement completion - Meets milestone of 100 Active Users or 10% for less than 1,000 seats customers.  
      - Definition of when migration is complete - Migration is complete when we have migrated a predetermined number of users as per the FastTrack Benefit Services Description.  
    - Disengagement process is complete when:  
      - FM conducts an engagement completion discussion with the customer.  
      - Task "Disengagement process is complete" is marked complete.  

If the account is managed:  

- Engage with the Account Team to understand the customer's business, latest activities, overall strategy with Microsoft 365, blockers, issues, and any other account factors to consider.
- Clarify the Account Teams' objectives for the customer account for the current Financial Year.
- Clarify the customer's organizational structure and project team member roles.
- At a minimum, notify the Account Team that you are going to schedule a kickoff call with​ the customer and invite relevant account team person to the call.

### Schedule and Conduct Kickoff Meeting

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **RFA / Targeting / Customer Health**  
Applies To: **All Services**

For Request for Assistance (RFA) customers, the first step in this process is to contact the customer within two business days of assignment.  

Schedule and conduct kickoff meeting: use [Kickoff Deck](https://aka.ms/AA6s6ey) to leverage leading questions and key value points on the slides to start conversations. Capture and track any customer knowledge gaps during discussion to offer follow-up meetings/workshops with subject matter experts (SME) to address. 

In this kickoff, should you see project risks such as blockers, out of scope items, customer task constraints, etc. this is a good time to discuss the possibility of a FastTrack Ready Partner to compliment the FastTrack benefit.  If the customer would like to use a partner, execute task 983 to send a referral to a partner.  You can find content on Quickleads [here](https://aka.ms/AA5ctuy), and to enable the request you can find the email [here](https://aka.ms/AA6cav5).

Examples:  

 - ​Overall project management​  
 - Complex solution designing and customizations  
 - Out of FastTrack scope
 - Adoption and change management needs  

For existing customers that have become eligible for Windows 10 deployment assistance, use the kickoff deck to set the right expectations around the FastTrack Benefit.  

- Follow resource request process to add a Windows 10 deployment SME to your engagement. 
- Windows 10 deployment by FastTrack requires SCCM at current branch, yet this SCCM upgrade is out of scope in our benefit. Use partner Quickleads process above to support SCCM upgrade. 
- Leverage Kickoff deck slides for Windows 10 scope and Windows 10 Partner- led services located in the appendix.
