# Automated Onboarding Assistance

Phase: **Automated Onboarding Phases**

## Overview

The Automated Onboarding Assistance process in FastTrack is a set of bots and wizards that provide on-demand support to customers with limited direct FastTrack engagement to augment the traditional proactive
onboarding model FastTrack uses.

## Objectives

Automated Onboarding Assistance is a passive (Reactive) onboarding model that includes:

  - Email support as needed, leading with public wizards to help customer.
  - If customer asks for help, initial asks are fielded by reactive owners.
  - If issue goes beyond reactive depth, it can be escalated to FM/FE.
  - Once issue is addressed, customer returns to Reactive effort.

## Approach

### Public Wizards Link
