# Approach - Get Modern

## Overview

### Get Modern? Why am I seeing this?

- Internal-only term used to refer to Windows 10 and Office 365 PropPlus deployment with cloud-connected management.
- Externally please use the product names, e.g. deploy Windows 10, deploy Office 365 or enable cloud-connected management.
- You will see this term in FTOP, this playbook, and other areas where you and Microsoft employees access the same content and tools.
- Please do not use this term with your customers or outside of your interaction with FastTrack.

The FY20 Get Modern motion is designed for FastTrack Managers, Engineers, and Partners with support from Get Modern Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and Get Modern FastTrack Architects (GM FTA), to guide qualified customers through the Windows 7/8.1 to Windows 10 migration, as well as deploying Office 365 ProPlus using System Center, while promoting Cloud Management in partnership with the EMS team.

## Objectives

The following is a list of objectives for this approach:

- **Keeping our customers secure and helping them to shift to Windows 10** is imperative.
- As we help customers get modern with Microsoft 365, securing endpoints with Windows 10 is also of strategic importance to Microsoft in a competitive landscape.
- **Ensuring customers deploy and use the latest cloud connected Office client applications** in organizations is critical as we continue to support our customers as they prepare for Office 2010 end of **support and through their digital transformation journey.**
- Office 365 ProPlus is of strategic importance to Microsoft among competition as we shift our customers to the cloud with Microsoft 365.

## Approach
