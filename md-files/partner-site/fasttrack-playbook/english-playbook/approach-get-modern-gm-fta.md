# Get Modern FastTrack Architect (GM FTA) Engagement

## Overview

FastTrack Get Modern FastTrack Architect team is a customer facing, onsite role. The mission is to work closely with customers during onsite visit, set up a comprehensive, effective and agreed upon Windows 10 deployment plan, and see through the execution by remote FastTrack technical team members. Get Modern FastTrack Architect members will also assist on unblocking customer side challenges and escalations by working closely with customer stakeholders and Microsoft engineering teams.

## Objectives

The following is a list of objectives for this playbook:

  - How to work together with other FastTrack teams, such as:
    
      - FastTrack Architects (FTA)
    
      - FastTrack Gateway
    
      - FastTrack Center (FTC-CSS)
    
      - FastTrack Ready Partners (FRP)

  - Steps to plan a successful customer visit.

  - Deliver a comprehensive, discussion-based review of the customer current plan for Windows 10 adoption

  - Level set the customer on new technology that could accelerate their current plan

  - Build a (or customer an existing) Get Modern plan that accelerates their deployment of Windows 10 & Office 365, preferably using Modern Management practices

  - Help with blocking issues and escalations

  - Provide data and insights to Microsoft leadership and engineering teams

## Approach 

Primary Role: **Get Modern FastTrack Architect (GMFTA)**  
Applies To: **Get Modern (Windows, Office 365 ProPlus & Intune**

There are two methods of engagement for the Get Modern FTA; reactive engagement from CSS delivery or a proactive engagement assigned by the Get Modern program team. Both methods are inputs to the same executions steps for the Get Modern FTA.

**Engagement Method 1: Proactive**

  - Assignment by the Get Modern program team.

  - The GMFTAs will facilitate an internal sync with other FastTrack resources assigned to the customer (FM, FE, SME, FTA) and the ATS, to understand the current status of any in-flight activities as well as explain the objective of the proactive assignment. At a minimum, the same data collected by the Gateway Team should be validated on this internal sync.

  - The GMFTAs contact the account team to coordinate the targeted motion in collaboration with the other FastTrack resources assigned to the customer (FM, FE, SME, FTA).

**Engagement Method 2: Reactive**

1.  A Re-engagement Manager from the FastTrack Gateway team will contact the assigned GMFTA to discuss the customer as part of their initial customer research as they execute the Get Modern Gateway Approach.

    a.  The GM FTA should promptly reply to the query, assisting the Gateway team by providing insight into the customer's current status regarding their Get Modern journey & deployment plans.

2.  The Gateway team will continue their process of internal outreach, customer research and then engage the account team to coordinate the Get Modern benefit. At this time the GMFTA will be asked to join the
    collaboration with the account team as part of the FastTrack team (GW, FM, SME, FTA) and the ATS.
    
    a.  If the account team is unable to qualify the customer with the Gateway team's Get Modern Customer Validation, they'll be asked to introduce the Get Modern benefit & FastTrack team (including GMFTA) to the customer.
    
    b.  Qualifying customers will be assigned to CSS or FRP for remote delivery.
    
    c.  Customers who do not qualify will be referred to a partner and provide the Get Modern deployment guidance.

3.  If no FM or GMFTA are assigned at this stage in the Gateway Approach, the Gateway team will request both assignments.

4.  The Gateway team will facilitate a warm handoff to include the GMFTA, FM, FE, SME, FTA and the ATS, then disengage.
