# Adoption Continuum

Phase: **Multiple Phase**

FastTrack offers [user adoption services](https://youtu.be/0WEr20MycO4) as part of the evolving array of FastTrack services by providing comprehensive guidance, content, and best practices for a successful Office 365 rollout to customers who use FastTrack services. These resources include guidance on how to generate awareness, gain executive buy-in, and implement end-user training in addition to the technical guidance, onboarding, and migration services already provided through FastTrack.

FastTrack also provides end-user awareness kits and [end-user training](http://aka.ms/officetraining) for some of the most fundamental usage scenarios to help customers launch Office 365 and begin readying their employees. Demonstrating how Office 365 is relevant in the context of a customer's business, roles and functions will help employees in any organization understand how to achieve more with Office 365. Customers can also browse through new industry-based and role-based scenarios to identify new ways of supporting business stakeholders with Office 365.
