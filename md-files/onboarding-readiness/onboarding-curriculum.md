## Supporting Learning

### Supporting Components

#### Peer Mentoring

Each new hire is assigned a pod manager, a role lead, and a mentor. Mentors and new hires are aligned to have the same role lead.
Mentors are senior members in a FastTrack role with one year or more of experience in the organization. To become a mentor, skills are evaluated by hiring/team managers and each individual must complete all new hire training and learning path for their role. Each Mentor is assigned 2 mentees for a maximum of 90 days.

Mentors focus on how an individual delivers the content; making sure they are comfortable talking to a customer with a flowing conversation. Mentors also listen for soft skills such as communication and presentation skills and provide guidance on how to improve, as necessary.

Mentors use a variety of techniques to support their mentees including:

|Technique  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
Shadowing   |To learn how content is delivered to customers effectively and efficiently, mentees listen to calls conducted by mentors. |
|Mock calls |Mock calls are coordinated between mentors and mentees on an as-needed basis. The mentor acts as the customer and listens to the mentee deliver the content and asks questions to test the mentees knowledge of the content. The number of mock calls needed depends upon the skill level exhibited by the mentee and the mentors evaluation.         |
|Reverse call shadowing  |Reverse call shadowing occurs when mentees are ready to talk to customers. Mentors listen in on customer calls led by mentees and provide feedback after the call.         |

#### Mind the Gap - Americas (soon to be available in other regions)
