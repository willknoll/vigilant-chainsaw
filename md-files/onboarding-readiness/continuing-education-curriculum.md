# Continuing Education Curriculum

The onboarding curriculum consists of mandatory and optional programs, self-study documents, videos, and e-learning modules applicable to specific roles within FastTrack. Curriculum includes knowledge assessments that a user must pass to receive credit for completing a course. Mandatory content must be completed by all personnel in a specific time frame.

## Continuing Education

### Continuing Education Components

#### Change Management

Courses provide learning required to effectively prepare FastTrack personnel for planned monthly releases. FastTrack monthly releases consist of changes to the FastTrack program, workloads, processes, and tools.

#### Self-study

Role-specific learning for core onboarding, Microsoft 365 workloads, and FastTrack tooling are available, in prioritized order. Self-study material is outlined in the Learning paths section coming soon.

Each Microsoft 365 workload or feature area has self-study content, categorized into one of four learning levels.  Level 100 and 200 are part of the foundation material. Level 300 and 400 are part of the supporting material.

|Level  |Level Description  |Role  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Level 100  |Essential material         |Required for all new hires         |
|Level 200  |Intermediate material         |Required for all new hires depending on role         |
|**Level 300**  |Advanced material         |Required for SMEs         |
|**Level 400**  |Expert material         |Required for SMEs         |

#### Level Up

Level Up is an initiative created to leverage and reinforce all existing training available and to assist in the transfer of information and knowledge between peers. This type of mentoring/coaching program was designed to turn passive learning into active learning. Level Up is optional complementary interactive training for leveling up an individual’s technical and soft skills.
Level Up aims to:

- Complement/Leverage/reinforce existing training

- Turn passive training to active learning (and assist with knowledge retention)

- Improve workforce effectiveness and confidence

- Exchange internal knowledge from the field and assist in the transfer of knowledge among peers

- Real customer scenarios and role playing

- Facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration and learning

- Turn SMEs into learning facilitators helping in the development of others

- Promote a safe environment for people to learn together eliminating the feeling of “stupid questions”
