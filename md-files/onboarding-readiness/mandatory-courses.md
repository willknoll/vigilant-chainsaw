## Customer Data Handling

As a component of the company-wide mandate to ensure compliance with all customer data handling, all FastTrack personnel must complete the security trainings and attest to their completion by signing the attestation form, see [FTattest form](https://aka.ms/FTattest).

## Business Conduct

Microsoft's Standards of Business Conduct courses have been developed to show Microsoft employees how to approach ethical challenges with integrity while building trust and achieving more.  

Standards of Business Conduct courses are mandatory for Microsoft full time employees and they are optional for everyone else. We highly recommend everyone completes the courses.
