# Customer Help

A customer may have requests that are either not part of the scope of FastTrack Center (FTC) or require additional help outside of standard delivery procedure. Here are some common questions:

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Question: What can I do if my customer is having difficulties with onboarding Office ProPlus (OPP) because of compatibility issues?**  
**Answer:** App Assure is Microsoft's message that, "we have your back on app compatibility" with Windows 10 and OPP. This program provides the customer with access to a Microsoft Engineer who will assist in remediating any compatibility issues that the customer experiences with regards to Windows 10 and OPP. To learn more, review the  [App Assure Customer Introductory Workshop deck](https://aka.ms/AA7629b).

**Question: How can my customer submit a request for an Architect to assist them?**  
**Answer:** Requesting a FastTrack Architect (FTA) can be accomplished by navigating to the [FastTrack Portal](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/), logging in, and selecting the desired tenant. Once you access the tenant details, select "services" and "Request for Assistance." If an FTA is needed, select that option. Otherwise, select "Request for FastTrack Assistance", fill out all required information, and your request will be processed.

**Question: Where can I direct my customer if they are not satisfied with the FTC resources assigned to their account?**  
**Answer:** If a customer is dissatisfied with the support they are receiving from their delivery team, they can request a reassignment by contacting a Technical Advisor, Regional Manager, or the Account Team. If the customer does not understand the limitations of the FTC, please direct them to the [FastTrack Center Benefit Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/o365-fasttrack-benefit-overview) documentation.

**Question: My customer has stated they are not satisfied with a service feature and wants to know if and when this will be rectified so that they can onboard the workload. What can I do?**  
**Answer:** Product-specific issues that are preventing a customer from onboarding, either due to product design or limitation, should be raised through the [FTC Insight process](https://aka.ms/ftcinew). Additionally, an Account Team can submit an OneList item, which will be reviewed based on feasibility and seats impacted.

**Question: My customer is having some technical issues that are beyond my scope, such as a complex migration from Domino to Exchange Online. How can we leverage assistance with this?**  
**Answer:** Topics related to in-depth technical issues during onboarding should be directed to a subject matter expert (SME) for further assistance. Refer to [FTC Resource Request Tool](https://aka.ms/FTCResourceRequest).

**Question: My customer wants to perform a tenant-to-tenant migration. Where can I direct them?**  
**Answer:** Tenant-to-tenant migrations and default domain changes are not supported by the FTC and would require the customer to leverage the assistance of a partner or Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS).

**Question: My customer wants some documentation on how to enable their end users to utilize the workloads. Where can I direct them?**  
**Answer:** While the FTC does not support user training, we do have alternative options to assist the customer. There are a number of Microsoft resources that are available to the customer, such as the [FastTrack Resource Hub](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/resources?rtc=1), [Office Support page](https://support.office.com/), the [Office 365 Training Center](https://support.office.com/office-training-center?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252fb8f02f81-ec85-4493-a39b-4c48e6bc4bfb), and [Online Interactive Guides](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Online-Interactive-Guides/Updated-Online-Interactive-Guides/m-p/28352#M1). Additionally, Microsoft has a great deal of IT professional content hosted at the [Microsoft Virtual Academy](https://mva.microsoft.com/). Outside of Microsoft, customers can leverage [Brainstorm](https://www.brainstorminc.com/), or [Global Knowledge](https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/) for user training resources.
