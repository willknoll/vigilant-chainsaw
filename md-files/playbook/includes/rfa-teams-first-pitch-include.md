# Teams First Pitch

## Type and use of document

- Topic category: Request for Assistance (RFA)
- Primary role: Gateway RFA FMs
- Use: Guidance for delivering the Teams First Pitch

## Summary

This article provides step-by-step guidance for Gateway RFA FMs to follow when delivering the Teams First Pitch as part of the process found in the [RFA Process Guide](../rfa-process-guide.md). The FM will employ this conditional step if Skype for Business is a requested workload and the customer is also eligible for Teams. The goal of the discussion is to drive intent for Teams by providing the Requestor with the information they need to understand the value of Teams considering its advantages over Skype for Business.

## Deliver Teams First Pitch

### 1. Contact the Requestor

1. Make 3 attempts to contact the Requestor:

    1. First attempt:

        1. Send the [Customer](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FastTrackAssignmentTeamLeads/Shared%20Documents/AiR%20Leads/Gateway%20RFA%20Team%20GitHub%20files/rfa-teams-first-pitch-1st-customer-requestor.msg) or [Partner/Microsoft](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FastTrackAssignmentTeamLeads/Shared%20Documents/AiR%20Leads/Gateway%20RFA%20Team%20GitHub%20files/rfa-teams-first-pitch-1st-account-team-or-partner-requestor.msg) **Teams First Pitch (1st Email)**, wait 2 business days for a response.

        1. After sending Teams First Pitch email, place the RFA **On Hold Pending Requestor Response**, updating the status in the [RFA Assignment Dashboard](https://ftop.microsoft.com/rfa/dashboard/#/) and the [FastTrack Portal](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/). (For guidance on this step, see the **Links to Status update guidance** section below.)

        1. Proceed to next step if no response after 2 business days.

    1. Second attempt:

        1. Reply to the initial email with the [Customer](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FastTrackAssignmentTeamLeads/Shared%20Documents/AiR%20Leads/Gateway%20RFA%20Team%20GitHub%20files/rfa-teams-first-pitch-2nd-customer-requestor.msg) or [Partner/Microsoft](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FastTrackAssignmentTeamLeads/Shared%20Documents/AiR%20Leads/Gateway%20RFA%20Team%20GitHub%20files/rfa-teams-first-pitch-2nd-account-team-or-partner-requestor.msg) **Teams First Pitch (2nd Email)**.

        1. Update the RFA status in the [FastTrack Portal](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/). (For guidance on this step, see the **Links to Status update guidance** section below.)

        1. Proceed to next step if no response after 2 business days.

    1. Third attempt:

        1. Reply to the last email using the [Customer](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FastTrackAssignmentTeamLeads/Shared%20Documents/AiR%20Leads/Gateway%20RFA%20Team%20GitHub%20files/rfa-teams-first-pitch-3rd-customer-requestor.msg) or [Partner/Microsoft](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FastTrackAssignmentTeamLeads/Shared%20Documents/AiR%20Leads/Gateway%20RFA%20Team%20GitHub%20files/rfa-teams-first-pitch-3rd-account-team-or-partner-requestor.msg) **Teams First Pitch (3rd Email)**.

        1. Proceed to next step if no response after 2 business days.

    1. Continue with RFA approval based on the eligibility of their requested workloads.

### 2. Respond to the Requestor

1. If the requestor responds:

    1. Schedule a call with the requestor to have a Teams **Business Value Discussion (BVD)**. You can use leading questions in the Customer Call Scripts/Battlecards or you can present the full Teams BVD [https://aka.ms/FTCTeamsPitch](https://aka.ms/FTCTeamsPitch).

        The goal of the discussion is that the Customer understands the value of Teams and is committed to deploying Teams.

    1. If the customer agrees not to deploy Skype for Business, enter **#stoppedSfB** in the entitlement notes for Skype for Business.

    1. If after delivering the **Teams First Pitch**, the customer still has intent to deploy SfB, send the [SfB Escalation Email](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FastTrackAssignmentTeamLeads/Shared%20Documents/AiR%20Leads/Gateway%20RFA%20Team%20GitHub%20files/rfa-sfb-escalation-email.msg) template and wait for approval confirmation from the SfB Escalation team.

        1. If the SfB Escalation team does not approve exception, notify the requestor at point of approval.

        1. If the SfB Escalation team approves exception, proceed to next section.

        1. Update the RFA status in the [FastTrack Portal](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/). (For guidance on this step, see the **Links to Status update guidance** section below.)
