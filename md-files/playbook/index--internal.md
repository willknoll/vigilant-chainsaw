## Engagement Motions

One deployment option does not fit the diverse situations of Microsoft M365
customers. FastTrack utilizes multiple engagement models to best
support a customer's cloud deployment journey. 

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible that a customer may engage in multiple motions during their lifecycle.
>
> For example, Commercial Services Monthly Active Usage (**CSMAU**) model searches for customers that meet certain critera and then may utilize the processes from the **Re-engagement** model before passing that customer back to the **Proactive** model.
