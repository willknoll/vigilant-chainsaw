# FTA Notes Guidance

[!INCLUDE [COVID Guidance](./includes/playbook-covid-guidance.md)]  

Primary Role: **FastTrack Architect**  
Applies To: **All Services**

FTA roles will utilize the *Enterprise Notes* for their updates.

## Objectives 
Enterprise Status notes should reflect:
- Understanding of the Customer intent
- Accountability for the success of the overall end-to-end deployment program as a trusted advisor in the process
- Driving the adoption conversation throughout the lifecycle
- Accountability for facilitating the landing of the FTC benefit where applicable to ensure customers fully exhaust the benefit

## Frequency 
There should be an update to the Enterprise Status every 2 weeks, not to exceed 21 days between updates.

## Location
FTOP tenant > Status > Enterprise Status 
Note: You must be assigned to the tenant and the Enterprise flag must be set to either *Level 3* or *Level 4* to edit these fields.

## Notes Content and Format 
**Reason (Required):** Options are: IT Maturity, >50k, Exec Relationship, Reactive, Major Brand, New Feature/Experiment and provide a simple reason for the customer being categorized as *"Enterprise"*. Select the appropriate one and click *Add*. Only update if this changes.

**Status (R/Y/G; Required):** Red indicates the customer is not currently involved in any onboarding efforts. Yellow indicates there would be ongoing deployment/adoption efforts, but there is a blocker or something significantly slowing the progress. Green indicates deployment/adoption is moving at an expected pace, given the circumstances. This is not the same as the *"Customer Health"* that is based upon percentage usage.

**Exec Summary (Required):** Crisp executive level summary that serves to answer the question: *What is preventing this engagement from having a Green status?* Answer format: High Level Topic, Brief Description, Impact, Action(s). Progress within the account, high-level situational awareness.

**O365 Deployment Status Current Overview (Required):** What are their adoption plans and where are they on the roadmap? Understand Customer intent, document opportunities to create intent.

**Current FTC Activities:** Quick update of FTC activities, including FTA activities. For the core workloads: Exchange Online (EXO), SharePoint Online (SPO) and Office 365 ProPlus (OPP), we need to have the status, blockers, next actions, due dates and actions.

**Risks:** Highlight any risks or concerns within the account. Describe efforts to respond to, resolve and elevate escalations and blockers.

**Public/Brand Name:** If the tenant name does not make clear the customer's brand affiliation or public company name, this is where you can provide clarity or recognition.

**Next Update (Required)**: Select the date you expect to make your next Enterprise Status update in FTOP.

**Awareness:** The value we bring is our situational awareness of the account. What is really happening, and what does our leadership need to be aware of? Consider including current strategy, partner activity, company restructuring/re-organization, etc. Our measure of success is adoption and customer satisfaction, so include things that would affect our ability to secure these capabilities.

S400 Customer Slide suggested lengths: 
- Executive Summary – 256 characters
- Awareness – 512 characters
- Risk – 512 characters

For context beyond these suggested limits, use a double hash (##) to cut the blob data automation to the Customer slide, where applicable. 

**Example:** This note is about an S400 customer. This portion will be fed to the S400 customer slide. ## This** portion will not.
