# Conduct Engagement Completion Discussion (enablement)
 
Phase: **Enable**  
Motions: **RFA**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Conduct Engagement Completion Discussion process completes the engagement with the customer for the workload or workloads submitted through a Request for Assistance (RFA) and concludes the
working relationship between the FastTrack Manager and the customer. 
This process is executed as part of the RFA
motion and when enablement is complete.

Enablement completion is achieved when the milestone of 100 Active Users
has been reached. For customers with less than 1,000 seats, enablement
completion occurs at the milestone of 10 percent.  

## Objectives

  - Customer has education and knowledge on completing the RFA form for
    future requests/inquiries.  
  - Customer has tools for the successful adoption of newly implemented
    cloud services.  
  - Customer is satisfied with the FastTrack engagement.  
  - Customer engagement is closed.  

## Approach

### Prepare for Engagement Discussion Conversation (enablement)

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **RFA**  
Applies To: **All Services**

After enablement is complete, you need to prepare for the customer
conversation.

If account team information exists:  

- Send an email to the account team contacts, letting them know that enablement is complete. Use [ATU email template​](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/ftccm/ESFoCde18MRBvb0N8VcQb3IBi1xr9_GVRg_33yEelscadw), which encompasses the following:  

  - Direction to have engagement completion review with the customer.  
  - Reinforcement that the FM will disengage after the review.  
  - Support from the account team in the engagement completion process.  

- If there is no account team information, follow guidance in Conduct
Engagement Completion Discussion section. 

Refer to the [RFA Customer Engagement Completion Discussion FAQ](https://aka.ms/RFAFAQ) for guidance on how to execute Customer Engagement Completion Discussion process and address customer unique scenarios or concerns. 

**Step Inputs (the checklist of items you should collect to be successful with this step)** 
- Documented in Engagement Management note that the customer achieved active usage milestone (100 active users for customers with > 1000 seats, 10% active usage for customers with > 1000 seats) per LYNX  or when the customer confirms that there are no technical blockers that prevent deployment. 

**Step Outputs (the set of items you should make sure are documented to successfully exit this step)** 
- If the Microsoft account team is known, or account managed, documented in Engagement Management note that account team was sent the ATU email template
- If the Microsoft account team is not known and / or the account is not managed, documented in Engagement Management note that the Microsoft account team is not known, the account is not managed (or both if applicable) and that the FM has reviewed the RFA Customer Engagement Completion Discussion FAQ to determine next steps and list in note the next steps  


### Conduct Engagement Completion Discussion (enablement)

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **RFA**  
Applies To: **All Services**

The engagement completion discussion should be held during the
customer's existing cadence. Note that if you are supporting an RFA
customer who has requested assistance for multiple services in one
request, you will need to complete this process as you complete
onboarding of each workload.  However, the FM will only disengage from
the customer, once the last service is complete. ​  

Refer to the [RFA Customer Engagement Completion Discussion FAQ](https://aka.ms/RFAFAQ) for guidance on how to execute Customer Engagement Completion Discussion process and address customer unique scenarios or concerns. 

The engagement completion discussion should cover the following:  

- Review completed activities.

- Identify if customer is ready to onboard an additional workload.  

  - If customer is ready to deploy another workload:

    - Provide customer instructions on how to submit an RFA request.
    - Demo how to fill out RFA form.

  - If customer is not ready to start onboarding an additional workload proceed to next step.

- After conducting engagement completion discussion, send the customer a follow up email. Use [Customer email template](https://aka.ms/AA7628i).
