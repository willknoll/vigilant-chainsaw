# Customer Health - Partnering with a FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP)


## Overview

S1500 customers are strategically important to Microsoft and as a result
we take extra care within the FastTrack program to ensure they have a
positive experience when onboarding to M365, including assigning a
FastTrack Architect (FTA) and a Customer Success Manager (CSM) to the
customer and holding regular status reviews so that we support the
customer in gaining value from their investment and to ensure we know
about, and address, any issues or blockers at an early stage.

Where a FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP) registers to be assigned to
workloads for an S1500 customer, we need to make sure that we continue
to provide the customer with the same level of support and experience
that they would get with a Microsoft FastTrack Center (FTC) engagement.
To that end, the FRP should work in partnership with the Microsoft team,
including the FTA, CSM, Account Manager, any existing FTC FastTrack
Manager (FM), and others with key relationships with the Customer, to
ensure a joint approach and to share necessary information to best
enable a successful outcome. To achieve this, it is essential to clarify
the key partnership relationships and activities that are required from
an FRP assigned to S1500 customer workload(s).

Every S1500 customer will have a Microsoft FM and/or FTA assigned who
will be accountable for the overall Customer Health, situational
awareness, and coordination of Microsoft and Customer resources deployed
on the customer’s tenants and workloads.

## Objectives

  - Microsoft will assign a FM for the customer who will work with the
    FRP point of contact (PoC) for the customer, such as Project
    Manager, solution architect etc.

  - The FM will provide regular status updates in FTOP in every 1-2
    weeks, or if a significant event occurs with the workload the FRP is
    assigned to, based on inputs from the FRP PoC.

## Approach

### Identify If There Is an FRP Registered to Your Customer

Primary Role: **FastTrack Architect** and/or **FastTrack Manager**  
Audience: **FastTrack Center**

Find out if an FRP has been registered to your customer by looking at
FTOP Assignments view. If the primary RM assigned to a workload has a
name starting with “FTP”, that indicates an FRP has registered for this
workload,

> [!NOTE]
> Please do NOT remove any partner assignments in FTOP and do
> not remove the Primary RM Checkbox from the FTP resources on Services.
> If any changes were needed, please contact you Team Manager and PSM to
> invoke the formal process to do so.

**Cadence**: Once

### Initiate Collaboration with the FastTrack Ready Partner

Primary Role: **FastTrack Architect** and/or **FastTrack Manager**  
Audience: **FastTrack Center and FRP**

The Partner Success Manager (PSM) assigned to the FRP is the first point
of contact for the FM/FTA when initiating collaboration with the FRP.
The PSM should help the FM/FTA to establish a relationship with the FRP
and to set up a regular meeting rhythm with them. Note the PSM will not
continue to attend the regular meetings as these the responsibility of
the FTA/FM and the Partner.

1.  Find out who is the PSM for the FRP at
    http://aka.ms/fasttrackreadypartners. Select a partner, then in the
    Microsoft Account Details pane on the right-hand side you will see
    the name of the PSM assigned to the FRP.

2.  Reach out to the PSM, introduce yourself as the FM/FTA accountable
    for Customer Health and ask the PSM to introduce you to the FRP. The
    PSM should also give you a briefing of the FRP scope of work and
    other matters relevant to the FRP relationship with the customer and
    Microsoft.

3.  PSM should contact the FRP to introduce the FM and setup a first
    meeting with the FRP stakeholders for that customer engagement, as
    explained in the “First Meeting with FRP” section below.

Once the FM/FTA has established a direct contact with the FRP key
stakeholders, he/she should keep the PSM informed about the status of
working with the FRP on an ongoing basis. Should there be a need to
escalate any matters related to the FRP, the assigned PSM would be the
first point of escalation contact for the FM/FTA.

**Cadence**: Once

### First Meeting with FRP

Primary Role: **FastTrack Architect** and/or **FastTrack Manager**  
Audience: **FastTrack Center and FRP**

FM/FTA will work with the PSM assigned to the FRP to schedule the first
meeting with the FRP key stakeholders, as explained in the “Initiate
Collaboration with the FastTrack Ready Partner” section above.

In the first meeting with the FRP, the FM/FTA explains the Customer
Health Motion, presents the engagement model, and what are the benefits
of working together for the FRP, customer and Microsoft, as well as the
roles and responsibilities of the FRP, PSM and FM/FTA.

> [!NOTE]
> FRPs do not have a different approach for S1500 customers as
> that categorization is internal to Microsoft. FRPs will have the same
> delivery and engagement model with customers regardless of whether the
> customer is part of any FastTrack motions or not.

Talking points for the FM/FTA

  - Explain the recommended engagement model, better together. For the
    S1500 customers Microsoft is making an investment to help these
    customers attain their goals of their journey to the cloud, health,
    ROI, etc. Microsoft is helping everybody to be more successful,
    win-win-win\!

  - Benefits to the FRP include a) good joint governance helps address
    issues and risks quickly before they become blockers, b) assistance
    from Microsoft (SMEs and other roles) is available to the partner as
    needed, c) FM is not replacing any roles or activities of the
    partner but is a liaison between the partner and all other
    stakeholders.

  - To achieve this, there will be regular sync meetings to discuss the
    engagement status and any help needed, as well as to get the input
    from the FRP that contributes to forming an end-to-end situational
    awareness of the health of the customer engagement.

**Output**: The FRP agrees to working together with the FM/FTA to help
drive customer health, specifically by attending regular status review
meetings and providing data for FTOP updates.

### Regular Status Review

Primary Role: **FastTrack Architect** and/or **FastTrack Manager**  
Audience: **FastTrack Center and FRP**

The Microsoft team, led by the FTA/FM, will hold regular status review
calls/meetings which the FRP PoC shall attend, to share key status and
actions, contributing to the creation of a status slide for the
customer. The status slide shall be completed by the FM/FTA and will
include input from the FRP on appropriate information for their assigned
Service(s). A template for the status slide is provided to show the
information that is collected. In the event of significant incidents or
escalations from the customer, the FRP PoC shall notify the FTA/FM who
will then involve the Microsoft team such that the Microsoft team can
support the FRP and Customer in resolving any issues. This may include
engagement of Microsoft SMEs where necessary to resolve blocking issues.

**Cadence:** Every 1 - 2 weeks, depending upon life cycle phase

The above approach means that the FRP will have close links with, and
support from, the Microsoft team already engaged with the Customer, with
the intention that Microsoft and the FRP work together to ensure a
successful engagement. However if a pattern emerges with an FRP that
does not work in partnership with Microsoft, including meeting regularly
with the FTA/FM and providing the mandatory information in notes, then
assignment of the Customer / Service(s) to the FRP within the FRP
Program may be reviewed and further action taken with the transition to
others and a Microsoft FTC FM assigned to the Customer / Service(s).

### Update FTOP Data

Primary Role: **FastTrack Architect** and/or **FastTrack Manager**  
Audience: **FastTrack Center and FRP**

Data is a critical element of the FRP program and the FRP needs to
perform, and mark completed in FTOP, for the Services to which they are
assigned, and reflecting the appropriate phases of the project. This
Playbook may be updated from time to time to reflect learnings from the
program.

In case the FRP PoC doesn’t have access to FTOP, they will provide input
to the FM who will update data in FTOP accordingly.

The FRP PoC will provide the FM with Milestone Forecasts for 15% and 40%
milestones for those workloads to which they are assigned and will
update these if significant changes occur.

**Cadence**: Once per week
