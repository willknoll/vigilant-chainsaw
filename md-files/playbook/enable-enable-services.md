# Enable Services

Phase: **Enable**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**

## Overview

The Enable Services process guides a customer through configuring
services for consumption, migration and begin to experience the Enable
Service benefits.Â 

## Objectives

- Identify provisioning and synchronization are configured and active. 
- Ensure eligible workloads are configured in tenant and available for consumption.

### Deploy Mobile Apps 

Primary Role: **FastTrack Engineer**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **Intune / Office ProPlus / Windows 10**

Some customers prefer the built-in device management inside Office 365 to allow basic controls on mobile devices connecting to corporate data. Other customers need stronger security, so they use EMS or 3rd party MDM solutions to control apps and device access. For those customers that have Intune and AADP, they can configure a much more secure access model for mobile devices. See "Get Secure" guidance in task 3720 or engage an EMS SME to help drive these specific scenarios.  

**Basic MDM recommendations:**  
Mobile Device Management for Microsoft 365 Business Standard can help you secure and manage mobile devices like iPhones, iPads, Androids, and Windows Phones used by licensed Office 365 users in your organization.
