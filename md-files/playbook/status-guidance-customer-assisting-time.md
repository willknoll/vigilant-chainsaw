# 'Customer Assisting Time' Guidance  

## Applicability  
This guidance is for Fasttrack Specialists (e.g. FMs, FEs) who are **not** assigned or are **not** engaged directly  with a specific customer/tenant, but perform activities to “assist” (as defined below) other FastTrack specialists in onboarding a specific customer(s).  FastTrack Specialists are required to enter their time for those activities per the guidance below.  

## Activities Considered 'Customer Assisting Time'  
**Individual activities of typically 30 minutes or less.** 
- Planning for or participating in customer meetings
- Working with Microsoft internal teams (e.g. account teams, CXP, Support, etc.) related to a specific customer
- Researching a topic or gathering data for a specific customer
- Assisting another team member on a specific customer
- Entering any data in FTOP for a specific customer  

Note:  this is not an exhaustive list, but representative of the kinds of activities that would be included. Reach out to your Lead or Team Manager if you are not clear.  

## Activities Not Considered 'Customer Helping Time'  

- Backing up another FastTrack Specialist who is OOF.  You should be assigned to that tenant/customer and enter your time against that tenant/customer.
- Non-customer activities (e.g. mentoring another on the role, or other internally focused activity)  

## Guidance for Entering 'Customer Assisting Time'  

A non-customer specific tenant has been setup in FTOP for each region for the purposes of entering ‘Customer Assisting Time’.  FastTrack specialists should enter their time using the following guidelines: 
- Enter ‘Customer Assisting Time’ in the applicable ‘Time Assisting Others’ tenant for your region
  - ‘Customer Time Assisting Others Americas’
  - ‘Customer Time Assisting Others EMEA’
  - ‘Customer Time Assisting Others APJ’  
  
   Note: if you don’t have access to the regional tenant, contact your Lead or Team Manager
- Enter time a minimum of every week.  Daily entry is recommended to help ensure accuracy
- Enter time within the applicable workload for which assistance was provided; if customer related work covers multiple workloads, use good judgment to allocate the time proportionally 
- OK to enter Notes, but do not enter customer name or other PII/OII (protect customer privacy)
- Entered activities should be in 30 minutes (or less) increments
