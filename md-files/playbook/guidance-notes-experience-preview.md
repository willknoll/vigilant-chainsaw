# A New Notes experience within FTOP is coming soon\!

We have been hard at work incorporating your feedback and building a
completely redesigned Notes Experience within FTOP.  
Itâ€™s called the
**Notes Library** and gives end users a centralized way to both create
and consume Notes via a modernized and streamlined toolset.
