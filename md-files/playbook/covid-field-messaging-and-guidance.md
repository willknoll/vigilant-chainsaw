# Field Messaging & Guidance  

To help organizations and schools as they respond to COVID-19, FastTrack is providing assistance for setting up remote work and learning. For customers using the [6-month Office 365 E1 and G1](https://transform.microsoft.com/customer-trials?tab=o365e1trial) trials and the Office 365 A1 free student SKU, FastTrack assistance is also available now from March 2020 to August 2020 (see [FastTrack Service Description](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/m365-eligible-services-and-plans) for detail on this offer). Refer to this internal summary of all [trial offers](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/MicrosoftRemoteWork/EbEe9NOBCa1JnNWyoOJOwFcBPVw1hr83rhTnl75eMziTtw?e=aUTjR5) available to customers and the level at which FastTrack will support.     

Field, customers, and partners can request assistance at [https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack). Please familiarize yourselves [here](https://aka.ms/FTCovid19coverage) with the FastTrack COVID-19 coverage model and the exception process for  customers that do not meet seat requirements.

## Engaging FastTrack  

1. If your customer is already engaged with FastTrack, engage the assigned FastTrack Architect, FastTrack Manager or FastTrack Ready Partner.
1. If your customer is not already engaged with FastTrack, submit a request for assistance (RFA).  
   - Customer, Account Team, partner, or MCSâ€”visit the [FastTrack portal](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack) and select **Sign in** to request assistance.
   -  Select your customer from the list (or add customer if they are not yet listed), click on **Services**.
   - Before creating a Request for Assistance, check that FastTrack is not already working with the customer by looking under the Team Members tab. If FT is assigned, then contact the FastTrack Manager, FastTrack Architect, or the FastTrack Ready Partner.
   - Under the **Services** tab, use **Request Assistance with Microsoft 365** and follow the wizard.
   - If you are unable to request assistance using this method, you may email [ftcrfa@microsoft.com](mailto:ftcrfa@microsoft.com).  **Note:** Please only use this as a fallback method, as this is a manual process.

## Field and FastTrack Alignment  

The FastTrack Area Leads will continue to work with their Field Area leads (PMM/ATU/STU/CSU/EDU, etc.), as needed, to assist with their COVID-19 response. See coverage model here at: [aka.ms/ftcovid19coverage](https://aka.ms/FTCovid19coverage)
