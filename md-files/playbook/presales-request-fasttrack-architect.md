# Request FastTrack Architect
 
Phase: **PreSales**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Request FastTrack Architect process ensures that a FastTrack
Architect (FTA) is available for Enterprise and Small Medium Corporate
Customers (SMC-C) who own Microsoft 365, Office 365 (O365), or
Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) entitlements. The Account Tea​m
(ATU) requests a FastTrack Architect when an Enterprise customer is
minimally at 40% of the sales stage. The FTA helps customers and account teams properly position the FastTrack benefit, identify out of FastTrack Center (FTC) scope items, and provides additional guidance through discovery workshops as well as reviews requests for both the End Customer Incentive Funding (ECIF)/Digital WinRoom (DWR) from Enterprise and SMC-C customers and for migration exceptions.​​​ A global Pre-Sales Support team is available to fulfill other technical, delivery, eligibility, and support requests from Microsoft Services Sales (Sales), Global Pursuit (GPO), and Product Marketing Group (PMG) teams.

## Objectives

Identify the customer environment, requirements, and provide an optimum
roadmap to O365 and EMS early in the sales cycle.

  - Document out of FTC scope items to be used as the input for a
    partner or Microsoft Delivery Services team to build their
    proposal/Statement of Work (SOW). 
  - Review funding requests submitted during the deployment phases.
  - Remove barriers to adoption through a robust Pre-Sales Support
    model. ​
