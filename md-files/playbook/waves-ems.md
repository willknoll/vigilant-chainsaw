# Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS)

Program Manager: **Maria Conceição**  
Phase: **Waves**

[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)] 

## Overview
The presentation takes form of a 30 to 60 minute session intended to provide a deep overview on how FastTrack helps deploy and drive adoption of your M365 security solutions to meet your organization’s security objectives.

  - How does the customer need our help?

## Approach
