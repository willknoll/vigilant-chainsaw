# Conduct Customer Kick-off

Program Manager: **Rosie Arrieta**  
Phase: **Initiate**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Conduct Customer Kick-off process initiates the working relationship
between the FastTrack Center (FTC) and the customer with conversations
that focus on learning what the customer does, discussing what services
they own that may be helpful, and setting expectations around how the
FTC can support them. 

## Objectives

  - Listen to the customer's needs, to services they want to deploy and
    set expectations around FastTrack Benefit. 
  - Understand customer short vs. long term objectives and align to
    delivery timeline. 
  - Identify customer's current knowledge gaps in understanding product
    benefits and status of Adoption pre-requisites. 
  - When a partner is involved, determine scope between FastTrack
    Manager (FM) and partner. 
  - If customer wants to combine Kickoff and Technical Assessment
    discussions, review Deployment Enablement Plan.

## Approach

### Prepare for Kickoff Meeting

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

FM asks questions specific to the customer's concerns/needs to achieve
overall meeting objectives to fully:

- Understand the customer's context and background, licenses owned and activity to date from FTOP.  
- Complete required handover between Gateway/Re-engagement Team (GRT) and Delivery FM before reaching out to the customer. 
- Conduct background research on the customer, leverage resources such as LinkedIn and the customer's website to gain a general understanding of the customer's industry and core business(). Leverage the Account Team where account is managed.  
- If the engagement originates through a Requests for Assistance (RFA),  
  - Set the right expectations around the FastTrack​ Benefit and completion of a workload or service.  
  - FM will disengage from the engagement once it is complete.  
    - Disengagement occurs upon completion of enablement or migration if required.  
      - Definition of enablement completion - Meets milestone of 100 Active Users or 10% for less than 1,000 seats customers.  
      - Definition of when migration is complete - Migration is complete when we have migrated a predetermined number of users as per the FastTrack Benefit Services Description.  
    - Disengagement process is complete when:  
      - FM conducts an engagement completion discussion with the customer.  
      - Task "Disengagement process is complete" is marked complete.  

If the account is managed:  

- Engage with the Account Team to understand the customer's business, latest activities, overall strategy with Microsoft 365, blockers, issues, and any other account factors to consider.
- Clarify the Account Teams' objectives for the customer account for the current Financial Year.
- Clarify the customer's organizational structure and project team member roles.
- At a minimum, notify the Account Team that you are going to schedule a kickoff call with​ the customer and invite relevant account team person to the call.

### Schedule and Conduct Kickoff Meeting

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **RFA / Targeting / Customer Health**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Schedule and conduct kickoff meeting: use [Kickoff
Deck](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTOP/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=/teams/ftccm/FTOP/Localized/Kickoff%20Deck&FolderCTID=0x012000904F5E794E882F4D94FA3B0142FA461C&View=%7b1FF97C09-983E-40DE-BF97-D16BEFEB043E%7d)
to leverage leading questions and key value points on the slides to
start conversations. Capture and track any customer knowledge gaps
during discussion to offer follow-up meetings/workshops with subject
matter experts (SME) to address. 

In this kickoff, should you see project risks such as blockers, out of
scope items, customer task constraints, etc. this is a good time to
discuss the possibility of a FastTrack Ready Partner to compliment the
FastTrack benefit.  If the customer would like to use a partner, execute
task 983 to send a referral to a partner.  You can find content on
Quickleads [here](https://aka.ms/AA5ctuy), and to enable the request you
can find the email [here](https://aka.ms/AA6cav5).

>   - Out of FastTrack scope
>   - Adoption and change management needs

## Key Inputs

  - FastTrack Team is assigned and everyone on the customer's internal
    Microsoft team is aware of each other's roles and responsibilities.
  - FM completed the required handoff from Gateway/Re-engagement team.
  - FM conducted customer background research and has a general
    understanding of customer's industry, organized structure and known
    project team member roles. 
  - If customer is Managed, FM connects with Account Team.  

## Key Outputs

  - Customer and teams are introduced and understand each other's roles
    and responsibilities.
  - Customer understands what the FTC does, how the team can assist in
    making their organization successful and collaborating in Microsoft
    Teams (entitled customers) for onboarding collaboration. They see
    value in the benefits the FTC provides and wants to learn more about
    the resources available. 
  - Customer understands which services/licenses they are entitled to;
    If customer did not originally intend to deploy all workloads, then:
      - FM provides an overview of other entitled services they may be
        familiar with or did not realize they own. 
      - FM offers additional opportunities to learn more about these
        services (e.g., business value discussion (BVD), follow-up
        meeting with a SME).
      - FM discusses benefits of how deploying two or more workloads
        they already own together - instead of one by one - could be
        better. 
  - FM has solid understanding of customer's intent and current gaps:
      - Customer shared high-level business needs and expectations
        around overall success. 
      - Customer shared how and when they want to use software
        licenses. 
  - FM has solid idea of the resources the customer needs to get started
    and what he/she should demo/highlight during their next follow-up
    discussion.   
  - FM Captures DIBS, SSAT (if available) and any other relevant service
    entitlement notes.  
  - Teams is being used to collaborate and engage on Onboarding and
    Adoption related topics. 

## Next Steps

  - FM addresses gaps on intent prerequisites using [Guidance:
    Adoption 4+4 Pre-reqs and Success
    factors](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ftccm/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7bA993BBB9-C7E3-42CA-85FD-7D09C8BAC5F8%7d&file=Guidance_when_4%2B4_not_present.docx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true).   
  - FM schedules additional follow-up meeting(s) with project team and
    relevant stakeholders for discussions on specific services and
    scenarios to close knowledge gaps as needed (e.g., BVD, meeting(s)
    with technical/adoption SMEs, etc.)
  - Once outputs listed above are complete, move to \[\[[Conduct
    Customer Success
    Workshop](./assess-conduct-customer-success-workshop.md)\]\]
    and \[\[[Conduct Technical
    Assessment](./assess-conduct-technical-assessment.md)\]\]
    for guidance.
