# FRP Matching Process

Partner referrals - how customers match with FastTrack Ready partners (FRPs)

## In FY20 most customers outside of a proactive motion or targeted list will get matched with a FRP first.


### **Field-led matching**

Check the list of FRPs first ([http://aka.ms/FastTrackReadyPartners](http://aka.ms/FastTrackReadyPartners)) to select the Partner you want to engage to introduce the FastTrack benefit and offer their value-added services.

 ### **Request for Assistance**
 
 Customer or Account team submits a Request for Assistance to request the FastTrack Benefit.  
 
 ~75% of these will go to a FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP) - this is the default match in FY20.

---

### **When is a partner matched** 

FastTrack **matches with partners** with this criteria:  

- Eligible workload (150+ licenses) with intent
- Match by country / language, <1000 mile distance
- Workload has enough upside to be incentive eligible

The below criteria **excludes** a partner referral (will not go to a FRP): 

- Top 1500 customers or targeted workload 
- MCS-led engagement
- Insufficient AU to drive for a partner to earn an incentive - customer already at high usage
- US government or Black Forest customers 

--- 
### **Which partner is matched**

Customer is assigned to the nearest FRP (meeting criteria above) that has driven the most usage on the requested workloads or one already engaged with the customer.

Partner Center Business Profiles allows partners to list 5 locations per country - we use the closest to the customer address.  If we cannot find a match we may go beyond 1000 miles.  Existing partner relationships will be preserved.

### **Activity** 

Partner provides the FastTrack benefit per [FastTrack Service Description](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/fasttrack/O365-fasttrack-benefit-for-office-365) for all requested workloads at **no additional cost and showcases Value Added Services** (negotiated by customer/partner).
