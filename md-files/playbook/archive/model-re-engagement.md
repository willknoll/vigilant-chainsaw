# Re-Engagement Model

The Re-Engagement Phase uses standard, scenario-based methods to understand, influence and create intent by focusing on inactive customers and/or workloads. The Re-Engagement Team works with the customer to comprehend their business needs and help them realize the value of O365, Azure Active Directory Premium (AADP) and Intune suites. The Re-Engagement team performs the following tasks:

  - Maintains constant engagement with customers to maximize product adoption and usage

  - Creates product intent among the backlog of customers

  - Focuses on helping customers transform to a modern digital workplace with scenario-based customer usage profile

The Intent Team target list is ordered by priority (high to low) and uses formal business rules to select the highest available tenant to validate and identify appropriate customer contacts who drive successful use case scenarios, as well as schedule and conduct a customer discussion around defined target scenarios and delivery assignment.

The Initiate Phase process flow is depicted as follows:

  - Re-Engagement Phase → Tenant Targeting → Tenant Research → Customer Engagement → Assign to Delivery → Team Disengaged
