# Conduct Success Review

Phase: **Success**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Conduct Success Review process is a formal check-in with a customer
who reaches the minimum 10% active usage (AU) target for all intended
workloads or achieves their customer-defined success metrics to discuss
achievements to date, next steps and activities to accomplish them, and
understand whether the customer wants to evaluate new business
scenarios. If a customer is not interested in expanding scope, this
review is designed to educate customers to maintain usage momentum,
introduce new training resources, and engage more broadly with the
Microsoft customer community.

## Objectives

Establish customer intent:

  - For new workloads, identify gaps in customer understanding of
    product benefits, driving usage, and establishing the status of
    Adoption pre-requisites for new workloads; and identify an approach
    to address gaps with customer.
  - To sustain current usage, educate customers on best practices to
    maintain momentum for services deployed and help establish a plan to
    sustain successful consumption including how to:
      - Create a self-serve support function within the customer
        organization.
      - Build a champions community (if not in place).
      - Track and manage progress.
      - Determine where to locate training resources.
  - Set FastTrack engagement expectations with customer if the workload
    service usage is at or greater than 10% and customer does not want
    to use additional FastTrack services.

## Approach

### Conduct Customer Success Review Meeting

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Conduct customer success review meeting:

  - Set expectations with the customer about post-FastTrack experience
    when the customer does not want additional services and has plans in
    place to sustain momentum.
  - Support level is reduced because the customer is doing well, making
    progress, and can manage on their own. Use one of the following
    decks and customize slides to structure the conversation:
      - [Success Review
        Deck](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTOP/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=/teams/ftccm/FTOP/Localized/OneAdoptionWizard/Success_Review_Deck&FolderCTID=0x012000904F5E794E882F4D94FA3B0142FA461C) - original deck in One Adoption Wizard
    
      - [Guidance: Success Review
        Deck](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ftccm/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b82587434-3EF3-452F-A0B4-40E2A8A5C98E%7d&file=Success_Review_Guidance.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

Mark the conduct success review meeting task complete after meeting is
conducted, then complete the overall status if the meeting results in
any of the following outcomes:

  - Customer agrees to continue to engage FastTrack through additional
    business value discussions (BVD).
  - Customer agrees to enable additional workload entitlements through
    FastTrack.
  - Customer agrees to transition ongoing usage and adoption activities
    to the Customer Success Manager (CSM) for Enterprise Enhanced
    Adoption service​.
  - Customer chooses to disengage from FastTrack for future deployment
    activities.

Applies To: **All Services**

Conduct a BVD with customer if they want to learn about other services
and/or expand scope during post-enablement.

  - Refer to the [Business Value Discussion Guide](https://aka.ms/ftbvd)
    for links to workshops, reports, Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)s,
    guidance on how to deliver a BVD and capture task, status, and
    success factors in FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP) as
    appropriate for each service if not delivered during the
    [Conduct Adoption and Change Management Conversation](./assess-conduct-adoption-and-change-management-conversation.md)
    process.

    expert to help deliver a BVD.

### Emphasize Usage Reports

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Use Office 365 (O365) usage reports if customer wants to learn about
O365 usage reports after this meeting and has not participated in a
previous Measuring Success discussion:

  - Use [Measuring Success
    Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=843796) to set
    expectations around Success Metrics.
  - Use O365 usage report overview decks to demo O365 reporting
    capabilities. Refer to [O365 Download Center Bill of
    Materials](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54088)
    and [Guide: Measuring Success and M365 Usage
    reports](https://aka.ms/oawlink48) for details.  

## Key Inputs

  - Customer meets or exceeds 10% AU target for all intended services.
  - Employees/end users generally know how to use new
    services/capabilities by receiving some form of training and is
    capable of utilizing these services.
  - Customer meets its planned/expected success goals and knows how to
    manage/track progress (e.g., O365 Adoption Content pack).

## Key Outputs

  - FM reviews the customer's engagement and sets expectations for
    post-FastTrack success or established next steps for expanding scope
    (e.g., closing knowledge gaps, success planning).
  - Customer identifies continued ways to be successful on the M365
    platform services.
      - For Enterprise customers, the plan is understood by internal
        Microsoft teams and next steps are in place to support the
        customer.
  - If the customer does not plan to expand scope and is ready to move
    to a maintenance phase (e.g., has a plan for maintaining momentum),
    the FM has:
      - Shared best practices and resources for maintaining usage
        momentum.
      - Educated customers to access support for Microsoft 365 (M365) /
        Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) or contact the FastTrack
        Center (FTC) to add new services, if needed.
  - Send the Customer and Partner Experience (CPE) survey if incomplete.

## Next Steps

  - If the customer wants to expand scope or learn about new services,
    return to the [Conduct Customer
    Kickoff](./initiate-conduct-customer-kickoff.md)
    process for guidance.
  - Work with the customer to address any remaining gaps and establish a
    high-level approach to maintain momentum. Refer to the Key Outputs
    section.
