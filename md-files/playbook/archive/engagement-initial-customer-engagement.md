# Initial Customer Engagement

Program Manager: **Maria Conceição**  
Phase: **Engagement**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Engagement Customer and Document Intent process helps you to
understand a customer's intent to deploy to align FastTrack support and
successfully deliver an end-to-end experience.

The process starts by identifying which workloads the customer intends
to deploy by capturing standard metrics such as the target go-live Date
for production, Intent, Business Reason and Success owner (DIBS). Refer
to Guidance: [Adoption 4+4 Pre-reqs and Success
Factors](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ftccm/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7bA993BBB9-C7E3-42CA-85FD-7D09C8BAC5F8%7d&file=Guidance_when_4%2B4_not_present.docx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true)
for more information.   

Once the workloads are established, the next step is reaching out to the
Account Team, Partn​er and Customer to determine intent, or reaching out
after processing a Request for Assistance (RFA).  Then, the FastTrack
Manager (FM) identifies whether a tenant qualifies for assignment to
either a FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP) or Microsoft delivery resources.

## Objectives

  - Contact the Account Team, Partner and Customer
  - Obtain DIBS and influence intent (target go-live Date for
    production, Intent, Business reason and Success owner)
  - Assign tenant to Delivery and FRP when FRP is already engaged or,
    for an FRP referral when the customer wants assistance from
    Microsoft FastTrack Center (FTC) with onboarding and adoption.
  - Assign tenant options when unable to gather intent with DIBS, and/or
    FTC assistance is not needed.

## Approach

### Confirm Requirements for Processing

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Applies To: **Core Onboarding**

​Check to see if an RFA has been approved recently.  If an RFA has just
been approved on the tenant, go to the assignment option for Request for
Assistance (RFA).  
  
 

Check for duplicate tenants in the FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP)
to ensure you do not contact a customer that is already working with an
FM.  If an FM is already working with the same customer on a different
tenant, the tenant needs to be assigned to that FM.  Check for duplicate
tenants by searching for the Primary Top Parent Account ID (TPID) and
the company name to see if this customer has any other tenants already
in FTOP. You should also try searching on other variations of the name
(Boolean search) and abbreviations for the name if any.

  - If you find another tenant for the same customer, compare the
    company information and customer contacts in Viewpoint to see if it
    looks like the same organization. 
  - If the tenant is an additional tenant for the same customer,
    reassign the tenant to the existing FM and send them an email
    notifying them that an additional tenant for one of their customers
    has been assigned to them.   
      
     

Check to make sure the tenant meets the [Current Entitlement
Requirements](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ftccm/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7bD633B826-D7CF-457A-A3A5-2458457D7CE0%7d&file=Current%20Entitlement%20Requirements.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true).  
  
 

GoBack tenants (existing tenant in FTOP) only:  
  
 

  - If an FRP is assigned to the tenant, then do not work on the tenant
    and remove yourself and FTCQ GoBack Americas, FTCQ GoBack APJ or
    FTCQ GoBack EMEA from the assignments. 
  - If the tenant is assigned to CSS and there is activity that
    indicates that CSS is actively working on the tenant (i.e. updates
    to the overall status, updates to a workload, etc.) within the past
    90 days, then do not work on this tenant and remove yourself and
    FTCQ GoBack Americas, FTCQ GoBack APJ or FTCQ GoBack EMEA from the
    assignments.   

  

### Contact Account Team

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Applies To: **Core Onboarding**

It is important that all Account Team members are included in the
emails. The only exception is if there is more than one partner listed
and there is more than one Partner Dev Manager (PDM) or Partner Sales
Executive (PSE). If there are multiple PDM/PSEs, do not include them on
the same Account Team email. Instead, email all the Account Team except
the PDM/PSE’s, list both possible partner names and ask the Account Team
to confirm if this customer has a partner and if so, is it either of
these partners. Alternatively, you can email each PDM/PSE separately and
copy the rest of the Account Team on each email.

  - First Account Team Contact:
      - Send the [Account Team Contact
        Template](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTC%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=/teams/ftccm/FTC%20Documents/en-en.zip&parent=/teams/ftccm/FTC%20Documents&p=true)
        to all Account Team contacts and allow 3 business days for the
        Account Team to respond. [Email
        Templates](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTC%20Documents/Forms/Assignment.aspx)
        are also available for the additional FastTrack Center
        (FTC)-supported languages under Templates.
      - Update the [Overall
        Status](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ftccm/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b44785DD7-83B1-407A-9DF0-7A9877EA6405%7d&action=view&source=https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTC%2520Documents/Forms/Assignment.aspx)
        based on current guidance.
  - Second Account Team Contact:
      - If there is no response after 3 business days to your first
        attempt at contacting the Account Team, schedule a meeting with
        the Account Team.
      - If there is only a PDM and the tenant is unmanaged, then send a
        follow up email to the PDM in lieu of scheduling a meeting with
        them. PDMs are responsible for managing Microsoft’s relationship
        with the partner and the most they will be able to confirm is if
        the partner is working with a customer.  PDMs are not able to
        provide DIBS.
      - Update the [Overall
        Status](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ftccm/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b44785DD7-83B1-407A-9DF0-7A9877EA6405%7d&action=view&source=https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTC%2520Documents/Forms/Assignment.aspx)
        based on current guidance.
  - If the Account Team Responds:
      - If the Account Team provided DIBS, proceed to the [DIBS
        Flowchart](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:u:/t/ftccm/Efubn00G7A9CkF064bppMeEB9FUslhTQ_MogK0yZySYttQ?rtime=ORDdNQCO1kg)
        for the current guidance to determine the Proactive Assignment
        Option.
      - For each Account Team person that responds to you check IS
        ENGAGED on the Contacts tab.
      - If the Account Team adds/removes anyone from the Account Team,
        update the contacts tab in FTOP with this information and mark
        the additional members on the Contact tab as IS ENGAGED.
      - If the Account Team provides any Partner contact information,
        update the Partners and Contacts tab in FTOP with this
        information.
      - If the Partner that is engaged is on the [FastTrack Ready
        Partner
        List](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/c7c3e56c-a80b-4323-bdb1-402cf94ca2a5/reports/49386223-5d87-4d95-abcf-a18667dbcdcd?ctid=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47),
        follow the process to assign the tenant as a FastTrack Ready
        Partner is Engaged assignment option.
      - If the Account Team provides any customer contact information,
        do not update the contacts tab in FTOP with this information
        yet. Wait to add customer contact information to FTOP until you
        reach the Contact the Customer part of the process.

### Contact Partner

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Applies To: **Core Onboarding**

The Account Team is copied on all emails. The only exception is if there
is a PDM or PSE. Only copy the PDM/PSE associated with the partner on

  - Contact the Partner:
      - Send the [Partner Contact
        Template](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTC%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=/teams/ftccm/FTC%20Documents/en-en.zip&parent=/teams/ftccm/FTC%20Documents&p=true)
        and allow 3 business days for the Partner to respond. The
        Account Team needs to be copied on all emails. [Email
        Templates](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/FTC%20Documents/Forms/Assignment.aspx)
        are also available for the additional FTC Supported languages in
        the Templates section.

        based on current guidance.
  - If the Partner Responds:  
  - If the partner responds and they confirm they are deploying at least
    one workload for the customer:
      - Update the Partners and Contacts tab information as needed and
        set IS ENGAGED for each contact that responds and then do one of
        the following options:
          - If the Partner is on the [FastTrack Ready Partner
            List](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/c7c3e56c-a80b-4323-bdb1-402cf94ca2a5/reports/49386223-5d87-4d95-abcf-a18667dbcdcd?ctid=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47),
            follow the process to assign the tenant as a FastTrack Ready
            Partner is Engaged assignment option.
          - If they are not on the [FastTrack Ready Partner

            for the current guidance to determine the Proactive
            Assignment Option.
  - **If the partner responds and they are not deploying any workloads**
    for the customer, then do the following to remove the partner from
    FTOP:
      - Partner Name (on the Partners tab) = **No Partner Identified**
      - Microsoft Partner Network (MPN ) ID (on the Partners tab) =
        **N/A**
      - Remove associated partner contacts from the Contacts tab.
      - Examples of this situation include:
          - The partner says they are working on a SOW, but it is not
            signed yet with the customer.  
          - They have completed working on what they were hired to do by
            the customer and are not deploying any Office 365 or EMS
            workload now.
