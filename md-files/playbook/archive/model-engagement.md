# Engagement Model

The Engagement Phase identifies how the FastTrack team identifies which workloads the customer plans to use by documenting standard metrics like target date to start Deployment, Intent, Business reason and Success (DIBS) owner. Afterwards, the FastTrack team determines a customer’s intent to deploy purchased services and aligns the appropriate FastTrack support to successfully deliver an end-to-end experience for the customer.

The Engagement phase process flow is depicted as follows:

  - Engagement → Engage Customer & Document Intent
