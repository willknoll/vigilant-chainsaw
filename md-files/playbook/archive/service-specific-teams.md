# Teams

Program Manager: **Janice Stern**  
Phase: **Engagement**

## Overview
Currently, the FastTrack Center (FTC) is responsible for deploying Teams for all customers who have intent to use Microsoft Teams. This playbook outlines the steps needed to deploy core collaboration, simple meetings and conferencing, advanced meetings, advanced voice and Skype for Business (SfB) to Teams transition.

## Objectives
In an effort to understand how the FTC is delivering deployments, how they interact with other Microsoft Teams, and which FTC Delivery team is involved in a Teams deployment, FTOP tasks are used to track the key activities that are involved in a Teams deployment and SfB to Teams transition.

## Approach
Primary Role: **Engagement FastTrack Manager**

## Technical Assessment Activities
1. Assess Microsoft Teams (task 3268) and define success for customer. Conduct Discovery discussion with IT professionals and stakeholders to further understand technical scenarios and customer needs.  
- Start with walking the customer through the [Microsoft Teams Technical Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/Microsoft-Teams), (formerly Success with Teams), which is available on Microsoft docs.  
- Share guidance on [How to Roll Out Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/how-to-roll-out-teams).
- Discuss scenarios the customer is interested in deploying (e.g., core collaboration, meetings, calling, etc.).
- Once you understand the customer's needs, begin walking them through the guidance in Microsoft docs around the scenarios they want to deploy. Use these links as the basis for customer discussions:
   -  [Chat, teams, channels & apps in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/deploy-chat-teams-channels-microsoft-teams-landing-page)
   -  [Meetings & conferencing in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/deploy-meetings-microsoft-teams-landing-page)
   -  [Cloud voice in Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/cloud-voice-landing-page)
- Refer to the [FTC Teams Resources](https://aka.ms/FTCTeamsResources) for additional information and training. 

2. Create Remediation checklist (task 3070):
- Download remediation checklist and remove any services customer will not deploy.
3. Set up service workshop meeting(s) and/or demo additional technical scenarios, as needed. 
- Review Teams services in depth and address any questions, concerns or blockers. These calls would include any additional discussions you have with customers to demo features or further explain scenarios, use cases, benefits, admin settings, etc. Mark task(s) as complete, if delivered.
   -  3725: Simple Calls/Meetings Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) discussion
   -  3686: Subject matter expert (SME) – Advanced Meetings public switched telephone network (PSTN) discussion

# Mid-Touch Proactive SfB to Teams Transition

## Overview 
Currently, the FTC is responsible for assisting Mid-Touch proactive customers through the Teams transition. These ~1000 customers are organization that have been pre-identified by the Teams Program Group (PG) with the following criteria: have >500 seats and between 2000 to 10,000 SfB MAU. Filter on Wave Name = in NorthStar to see list of eligible customers. 

The Conduct Technical Assessment process for SfB to Teams Mid-Touch transition customers allows FastTrack to develop an understanding of the customer’s infrastructure and business needs, and determine the needs for a smooth transition to Microsoft Teams. This assessment includes understanding the customer’s current environment, user security model, remote access restrictions and any infrastructure constraints that may potentially slow the transition process. 

## Objectives
- Encourage the customer to upgrade from SfB to Teams. SfB plans to be sunsetted in the next few years, so we want to transition as many customers as possible sooner than later. End-of-life date has not yet been communicated. 
- Understand the customer’s timeline for transition and identify any potential blockers, challenges or concerns.
- Facilitate the upgrade and planning process.

## Approach
Primary Role: **Engagement FastTrack Manager**
