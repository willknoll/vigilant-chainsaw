# Delivery Commercial Services Usage Playbook

Program Manager: **Ryan Meehan**  
Phase: **CSMAU**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

This guidance is meant to provide guidance to drive up Commercial
Services Usage among targeted customers.  This process is meant to be
used by a set of ring-fenced Commercial Services Monthly Active Usage
(CSMAU) resources, or FastTrack Managers (FM) who have been designated
to engage on CSMAU motions by leadership.

FastTrack is focused on bringing new users to the service once getting
users to adopt modern workplace scenarios.

CSMAU is:

  - A count of unique active users using at least one of Office 365
    services
  - Are users using at least 1 Office 365 service in a meaningful way in
    the past 28 days?  

**Note**: CSMAU means how effectively we are bringing the first
Office365 (O365) service to a new user.

## Objectives

  - FastTrack Center (FTC) has a goal to gain +40.7 million additional
    in FY19, which translates to 23 million CSMAU in managed space.
  - Customer Support Service (CSS) team has a target of 8.5 million
    CSMAU in FY19, distributed across regions as:
      - Americas: 4.5 million
      - EMEA: 2.5 million
      - Asia: 1.5 million
