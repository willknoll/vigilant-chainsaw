There are two methods of engagement for the Get Modern FTA; reactive
engagement from CSS or FRP delivery or a proactive engagement assigned
by the Get Modern program team. Both methods are inputs to the same
executions steps for the Get Modern FTA.

**Engagement Method 1: Proactive**

1.  Assignment by the Get Modern program team, usually as part of a wave.
2.  GM FTA will facilitate an internal sync with other FastTrack resources assigned to the customer (FM, FE, SME, FTA) to both understand current status as well as explain the objective of the proactive assignment.

        Gateway team by providing insight into the customer’s current
        status regarding their Get Modern journey & deployment plans.
2.  The Gateway team will continue their process of internal outreach &
    customer research & then engage the account team to coordinate the
    Get Modern benefit. At this time the GM FTA will be asked to join
    the collaboration with the account team as part of the FastTrack
    team (GW, FM, SME, FTA).
    1.  If the account team is unable to qualify the customer with the
        Gateway team’s Get Modern Customer Validation, they’ll be asked
        to introduce the Get Modern benefit & FastTrack team (including
        GM FTA) to the customer.
    2.  Qualifying customers will be assigned to CSS or FRP for remote
        delivery.
    3.  Customers who do not qualify will be referred to a partner and
        provide the Get Modern deployment guidance.
3.  If no FM or GM FTA are assigned at this stage in the Gateway Motion
    the Gateway team will request both assignments.
4.  The Gateway team will facilitate a warm handoff to include the GM
    FTA, FM, FE, SME, FTA & then disengages.
