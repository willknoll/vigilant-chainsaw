Questions for the Customer:
1. **What is your company using for productivity today?**
    Expected responses (if they are using a competing product, move on to other workloads that the customer can use with FTC):
     - Not using a competetive product, using Office ProPlus
     - Office Professional
         - **What version? Have you spoken to anyone about the differences between the perpetual/Office Professional 2016/2019 and cloud/Office ProPlus versions of Office?**
     - Google Suite
2. **When was the last time you upgraded?**
    If they upgraded within the last year, they probably won't revisit immediately due to upgrade fatigue.
    **How well did the upgrade go? Did you encounter any problems? What went well, what didn't?**
    Listen for references to:
    - Macro Use
    - 3rd party integrations
    - Difficulties with internal training
    - *Any other notes could be relevant to next OPP upgrade.
3. **Do you have any other specific technical questions surrounding OPP? If so, we can schedule a meeting with an OPP SME. When is a good time for you?**
