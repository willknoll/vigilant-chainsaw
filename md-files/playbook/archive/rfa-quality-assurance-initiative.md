# RFA Quality Assurance Initiative

## When to use this document

- Reference ID: *QA-00*
- Topic Category: Quality Assurance (QA)
- Primary role: **RFA QA analyst**
- Initiative: **RFA QA**
- Use: **To gain an understanding of the QA Initiative and QA analysts' quality check process for completed RFAs**

## Overview

The Request for Assistance (RFA) Quality Assurance (QA) process ensures the RFA team is meeting accuracy standards by identifying improvement opportunities. The goal is to eliminate unnecessary steps in processing RFAs, to identify breakpoints, and to evangelize the RFA process so potential Requestors are empowered to take advantage of it and the FTC benefit.

The QA process uses an assessment of key factors to identify detractors and inefficiencies within the Gateway RFA process. Breaks in the defined process are categorized and analyzed to ensure that informed, effective quality improvement action can be taken.

## Objectives

- Assess two RFAs each week for every Gateway RFA FM
- Record the results of each assessment according to a pass or fail scoring system for each of eight key quality factors. Grading will be measured against the current process and further categorized into missed FM opportunities (departures from the documented process) and departures from the current undocumented process to identify documentation errors and omissions. The eight factors are:
    - Assignment
    - Tasks (2453 and 4021)
    - Engagement Scenario
    - Services tab
    - Overall Status Notes and FastTrack Portal status notes
    - Contacts
    - Partners
    - Next action fulfillment
- Identify quality opportunities through analysis of data
    - Top submitters
    - Productivity
    - Accuracy and completeness
    - Time to Complete RFA
    - Wait time for hand-off
- Provide regional leads assessment data specific to their team, including remediating recommendations based off of the data to support their quality improvement measures
- Categorize breaks into six categories for the identification for further quality improvement opportunities

## Approach

### Tenant selection

- QA analyst selects a random sample of completed RFAs that represent each RFA FM.
    - Two per day for each RFA FM (18 per week total)
- Lead provides tenants to QA Analyst.
    **Important:** The QA analyst may reject Lead selected tenants as candidates for assessment at the analysts discretion if the analyst believes the selection may skew the data.

### Assessment

#### Recording results

As this process is completed, the QA analyst simultaneously records the results of the assessment on a QA tracker. The tracker includes information such as tenant IDs, RFA FM, FM regions, and comments for notes elaborating on errors. Specifics regarding error categorization are also included. The analyst is able to filter and categorize the data.

Access to the data is restricted to the QA analyst and to leads for coaching opportunities; however, regional leads access is restricted to modified spreadsheets that include only data from FMs who are part of their regional team. Regional leads share individual results specific to each FM with the FM for coaching purposes.

If the assessment process is delegated to regional analysts in the future, there will be one  QA tracker for each region. The data from each tracker will be compiled by the lead QA analyst for reporting.

#### Conducting assessment

1. Review completed tenant in FTOP to see where the RFA FM assigned the tenant to.
1. Validate the assignment
    1. Check the FastTrack Portal for assignment business rules (workloads, language, Partner status, and MCS engagement status).
    2. Check FTOP for assignment business rules (S1500 or Targeted customers, active usage, Intune licenses, non-profit subscriptions, Government subscriptions, BlackForest customers).
1. Review the other assignment related factors checking FTOP for the following:
    1. Assignment
    1. Task 2453
    1. Engagement Scenario
    1. Overall Status Notes
1. Record assessment results on Excel tracking spreadsheet.
1. Review other factor, validating data and recording results on Excel tracking spreadsheet.

### Analysis

Analysis is intended to identify trending, or patterns of issues which can be improved or eliminated.

1. Determine error rate for each process being assessed
1. Identify trends and common errors in factors with error rates above 10 percent
1. Determine the total error rate for all factors combined
1. Identify regional error trends
1. Identify repeated errors on an individual RFA FM basis

### Reporting

#### Microsoft

On a Bi-weekly to monthly basis, the QA lead will join the RFA sync to provide input on quality related items. The QA lead will present the RFA teams quality status, displaying the QA data, progress, remediation steps and proactive measures being taken. FM specific remediation will be provided separately in coaching sessions from the QM, or the FMs lead.

#### Team leads

The team leads will receive two reports.

1. The Microsoft Gateway RFA team report described above
1. A report prepared specifically for the regional leads providing data on regional issues as well as FM specific training opportunities

## Next Steps

### Categorization

When the team leads meet with the RFA FMs on their team, they review breakpoint feedback. The opportunities will point only to documented process, otherwise the breakpoints will be categorized as "Undocumented". Undocumented errors may still receive feedback on how to improve, although the FM will only be held accountable to clearly documented processes.

The errors will be categorized into the following:
- FM opportunity
- Policy
- Process
- Outside influence
- Third party
- Technology

### Quality improvement opportunities

The data gathered through the RFA QA process will drive informed and proactive quality improvement projects to address issues identified in the six breakpoint categories.
