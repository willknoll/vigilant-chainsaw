# Conduct Adoption & Change Management Conversation

Phase: **Assess**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

Adoption & Change Management (ACM) helps customers drive value from
their organization's investments in M365 by increasing end user usage.
FastTrack Managers (FM) will introduce the need for ACM in order to
build intent with customers.

The Conduct Adoption & Change Management Conversation process occurs as
a follow up to the Customer Kickoff Call, and it will focus on the
following three areas:

  - Provide the customer with Microsoft's self-service resources to help
    develop skills for leading change and executing technology adoption.
  - Request an ACM Partner/s to offer adoption services that customers
    can purchase.
  - Introduce the customer to Learning Pathways, a customizable training
    solution that provides content through a Microsoft online catalogue.
    Learning Pathways is pending to be launched in FastTrack​. More
    information will be available at a later date.  

## Objectives

  - Understand customer's level of knowledge and interest in adoption and
    change management of M365.  
  - Introduce the importance of ACM planning to increase end-user usage.
  - Provide self-serve, pre-packaged ACM resources that customers can
    leverage to develop skills for leading change and technology
    adoption execution.  

## Approach

**Step Inputs (the checklist of items you should collect to be successful with this step)**
-	Engagement Management note documenting the following:
    -	Customer has completed the Kickoff Conversation, has been introduced to success strategies and initial resources to drive adoption (Customer Kickoff deck “Adopt” slide covered).
    - Customer’s agreement to participate in an Adoption and Change Management Conversation is documented in Engagement Management notes and DIBS are captured.  

**Step Outputs (the set of items you should make sure are documented to successfully exit this step)**

        - Champions network
        - Team Success and OneDrive Adoption Kits
    - Introduce a partner based on the customer’s ability (skills and bandwidth) to drive adoption with existing teams.


### Request an ACM Partner

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

During the Adoption & Change Management Conversation, if the customer states they don't have the skills or bandwidth to drive end user adoption you may request an ACM Partner for your customer through the QuickLeads partner referral request process. Partner referrals are "For Fee" services.

ACM Partners offer a combination of the following services.  
- Business consultants certified in Change methodology with proven success at increasing end user adoption.
- Advisory, consulting, and execution support that can be tailored to the customer's unique needs.
- In-person training and excitement days activities.
- Digital scale training platforms and gamification engagement models.
- Support staff augmentation to complement skill set and/or bandwidth.  

Customers can work with an ACM Partner for the following stages of the Change Management journey:  

- Advisory & Planning - Discovery & Assessment and Strategy Design
- Training & Advisory – Execution Support and Ongoing Support

Use the [ACM Partner Deck (Internal Only)](https://aka.ms/AA63lt6) to
learn how to position an ACM Partner with your customer. When
presenting to customers, use the [ACM Partner Deck (Customer Ready)​](https://aka.ms/AA7628n)
deck.  

If a customer is interested in engaging an ACM Partner to support Adoption and Change Management needs:

- If the customer is currently working with a non-ACM Partner, determine if the non-ACM Partner provides adoption and change management services to maintain the continuity of the engagement.
    - Many partners can provide ACM services.
- If the customer is not currently working with an ACM or non-ACM Partner, the account team can find a partner that aligns with the customer needs.
    - The Account team will find ACM Partners in the customer's geography and provide multiple partners for the customer to choose from.
- If no Account Team, follow the FastTrack QuickLeads Task 983 process. To enable the request, you may use the [FastTrack Partner Referral Request](https://aka.ms/AA6cav5) email template. When submitting a Partner Referral Request:
    - Identify what type of service the customer needs (i.e. Advisory and Planning, Training and Enablement, or both).
    - Obtain the customer's verbal approval to share PII data (contact information) with the partners we will refer.
    - Match partners by location and specialty needed. 
    - Advise the customer that the partner(s) will contact them directly within three business days.
