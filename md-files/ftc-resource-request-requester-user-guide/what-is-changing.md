# What is Changing

As of February 2020, **we will no longer be able to customize the SME Request Tool on Nexus** due to SPO changes, so we needed to move off the existing platform asap.

Dynamics CRM was the platform approved for **FastTrack Tooling vNext Production Pilot** and needed an in-scope tool with low risk to production to test with, making the Resource (SME) Request a perfect candidate.

The new Resource (SME) Request tool on Dynamics was built as **“MVP” / feature parity** to the old Nexus tool and will release on **Friday, February 28th**.

The Resource (SME) Request **process has not changed**. The existing FastTrack Playbook [Resource (SME) Request Guidance on GitHub](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffasttrack-docs.microsoft.com%2Fplaybook%2Fresources-fasttrack-subject-matter-experts-resources-guidance.html&data=04%7C01%7Clmoynih%40microsoft.com%7C3d1e0c5f29bb4f6486ff08d7b9a0bd79%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637181972369181142%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C-1&sdata=77U%2FPHblsSot5P6gAe1o8cr1AQYOkuWT3wxwvPX2ml8%3D&reserved=0) remains the same.
