>[!NOTE]
>If a customer is not on the eligible list but meets the 2,000 to 9,999 active SfBO user requirement and wants FTC assistance beyond what [**web-based collateral**](https://aka.ms/skypetoteams) and second level [**FAQs**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/faq-journey) can provide, the FM can post a request for a SME on either the [**FTC Resource Request site**](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/SitePages/FTC%20Resource%20Request.aspx) in Nexus or on the [**FastTrack-M365 > Teams and SFBO**](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2b225617cf0948a9b23dc4b9e5db7525%40thread.skype/Teams%2520and%2520SFBO?groupId=4be32c1a-84cf-43d6-b8a2-9986a996b0a5&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) channel to have their customer approved.
