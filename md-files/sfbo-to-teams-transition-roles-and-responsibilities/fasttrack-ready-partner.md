# FastTrack Ready Partner

For Mid-Touch Proactive Transition customers (e.g., 2K to 10K active SfBO users), FRP has first right of refusal to assist customers with SfBO to Teams transition​.

1. SME will reach out to partner to ask if they want to lead the transition (prioritizing tenants with 20%+ Teams MAU)​.

1. Partner has 2 weeks to respond - if no response, SME will take over customer and transition​.

1. If Partner says “yes” to leading, they need to remain aligned with the SME and keep them up to date on customer progress.  For task tracking purposes, they need to let the SME know when:​

    - Partner has reached out to customer on the transition conversation​

    - When partner is in strategy & planning and has validated the date the customer plans to be fully transitioned to Teams; need to provide date to SME for tracking​

    - When the partner is upgrading/moving the customer to Teams and when customer is in Teams Only mode​

4. If Partner is not willing to engage with the SME within 7 days of leading the engagement or SME feels progress communication is lacking, SME will raise this as an issue.  If partner does not address within another 7 days, SME will proactively reach out to customer and take over the transition.   ​

1. Upgrade to teams is completed when the customer is in Teams Only “Org” mode or if 100% of users are in Teams Only “User” mode.  If customer refuses to set these modes, Partner needs to notify SME so it can be documented and escalated, as needed.​
