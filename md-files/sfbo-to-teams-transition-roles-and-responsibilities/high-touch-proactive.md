# High-Touch Proactive

## SME Type

PG Customer Program Managers (CPM)

## Eligibility

- Tenants with 10,000+ active SfBO users
- Approved by Teams PG

>[!NOTE]
>FastTrack delivery and account teams should have been notified in FY19 if their customer is eligible for this benefit.  

## Scope

- Internal assessment
- Customer overview
- Strategy & planning
- Customer upgrading

## Accountability/Actions

1. Teams PG should have reached out to FM.

1. If a customer meets the 10,000+ active SfBO user requirement and has not been notified but still wants Teams PG assistance, FM should post a request in the [FastTrack-M365 > Teams and SFBO](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2b225617cf0948a9b23dc4b9e5db7525%40thread.skype/Teams%2520and%2520SFBO?groupId=4be32c1a-84cf-43d6-b8a2-9986a996b0a5&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) channel to have the customer reviewed and approved.  

> [!NOTE]
> Given the Teams CPMs are responsible for delivering this benefit, a post in the channel will trigger a request for a CPM, not an FTC Teams SME.
