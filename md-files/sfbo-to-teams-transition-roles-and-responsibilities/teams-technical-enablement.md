# Teams Technical Enablement

## SME Type

FM, FE, FT Core Teams SME

## Scope

- Assist as needed per the SME request form
- Can help remove blockers, address deep technical issues, etc.

## Eligibility

500+ paid seats

## Accountability/Actions

For general how-to questions, guidance, and advice, FM/FEs can post in the FastTrack-M365 > Teams and SFBO channel. We have Teams SMEs and Teams Engineering experts monitoring who can help guide you.

1. Post questions in [FastTrack-M365 > Teams and SFBO](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2b225617cf0948a9b23dc4b9e5db7525%40thread.skype/Teams%2520and%2520SFBO?groupId=4be32c1a-84cf-43d6-b8a2-9986a996b0a5&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) channel.

>[!NOTE]
>If FE/FMs haven’t received a response within 24 hours or still cannot get a customer’s issue resolved through the collaboration channels, you can request a SME for customers (500+ seats only).  

**CHANGE:** In FY20, all technical requests for Teams SMEs should be submitted by an FE/FTA to reduce any unnecessary clarification discussions.

2. Submit a SME request at the [FTC Resource Request site](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ftccm/SitePages/FTC%20Resource%20Request.aspx).

>[!NOTE]
>Given the limited number of SME resources available in FY20, if a SME is assigned, he/she will focus on addressing the specific issue/question identified and will not remain working with the customer for a long period of time.
