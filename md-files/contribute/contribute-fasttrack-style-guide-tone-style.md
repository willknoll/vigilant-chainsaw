# FastTrack Style Guide

## Tone and style
    
### Target audience

FastTrack targets medium to large enterprises with 150 or more licenses. These customers typically have many assets to track and may find it more challenging to migrate to the cloud. We talk to our customers in a way that makes them feel important, listened to, informed, and respected. Individuals can range from high-level decision-makers to hands-on IT staff, but they are all just people looking for guidance. Always try and imagine you are face-to-face and project friendliness in your content.

### Tone of voice

The Microsoft voice encompasses how you talk to people, including tone, vocabulary, and personality. Write to make customers feel important, listened to, informed, and respected. Try to balance a friendly voice with clear, accurate language. Simple sentence structures help. Use a voice that's:

  - **Warm and relaxed**—We write naturally. Less formal, more grounded in honest, everyday conversations, like talking to a friend. Occasionally, we're fun. (We know when to celebrate.)

  - **Crisp and clear**—We're to the point. We use short words. Short sentences. We write for scanning first, reading second. We lead with what's most important. And eliminate nonessentials.

  - **Ready to lend a hand**—We show people we're on their side. We anticipate their real needs and offer great information at just the right time. They're inspired to move forward.

Refer to the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2700) **Microsoft's brand voice** section for complete guidance and examples.
    
### Sentence structure

Shorter is always better, so get to the point fast. Think crisp minimalism. Where possible, start each statement with an active verb. 

Lead with what’s most important. Start with keywords so skim-readers spot them easily. Make customer choices and next steps obvious. Give customers just enough information to make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word but write in complete sentences.

Be consistent in your word choice. Use just one term for the same thing in all of the content. Mixing and matching terminology can lead to confusion and mistranslation.

  - Cut *you can* and *there is*, *there are*, *there were*.

  - Be friendly and conversational. Use common contractions: *it’s*, *you’ll*, *you’re*, *we’re*, *let’s*. Don’t mix contractions and the spelled out version in the same content.

  - Include articles like *the*, *a*, *an*. Articles help translators identify the nouns and modifiers in a sentence.

  - Avoid words and phrases that are subjective (*easy*, *quick*, *seamless*) or that are overly superlative (*world*-*class*, *lightning*-*fast*, *awesome*, *amazing*).

  - Don’t use *(s)* to form plural nouns (*partner(s)*, *device(s)*). Make things plural if you’re talking about more than one.

  - Avoid using ampersand or plus symbols (&, +).
    
### Headings

Headings provide both structure and visual points of reference to help readers scan content and find entry points. In your content, use headings consistently. 

Write short headings that lead with the most important idea. Headings form an eye-catching outline for the content. If readers don’t read the headings, they probably won’t read the text. Focus on what matters to the customer, using words they’d use themselves to describe what they can achieve or need to know.

  - Keep headings as short as possible but keep *a*, *the*, *that*, and verbs for translation.

  - Avoid hyphens where possible to avoid awkward line breaks that may appear when the user resizes their window or views the content using a mobile device.

  - Avoid using ampersand or plus symbols (&, +).

  - Use sentence style capitalization. Only capitalize proper nouns: *Templates and themes for Office Online*.

  - Don’t use end punctuation in headings (no periods, questions marks, or exclamations).

  - Use parallel construction.

***Example*** <br>
The writer used noun phrases for the three first-level bolded headings and used verb phrases for the two second-level headings. This isn’t parallel construction.
