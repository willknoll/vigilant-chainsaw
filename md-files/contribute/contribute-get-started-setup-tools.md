# Install and configure your tools
This article describes how to install the tools needed to edit and submit your content updates.

## Browse to GitHub.com and sign in

You'll use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) to manage and publish your articles to the FastTrack Docs site. Make sure you're signed in with the GitHub account you [set up previously](contribute-get-started-setup-github.md).

## Install GitHub Desktop

Install [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). You'll use GitHub Desktop on your local machine to manage your content. Once you've installed GitHub Desktop, add [your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github/). 
> [!NOTE]
> When adding the account, make sure to choose **GitHub.com account**, not **GitHub enterprise account**.

## Install Git command-line tools

Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Accept all of the options when the installation wizard runs. You don't need to use the command line tools, but they need to be installed on your computer to enable some features in Visual Studio Code (*VS Code*). 

## Install Visual Studio Code

Markdown is a light-weight markup language that's designed to be easy to read and easy to learn. Because of this, it's rapidly become an industry standard. In order to write articles in markdown, we recommend that you download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is Microsoft's markdown editor. 

## Next steps
Content edits are made in a repository (*repo*) stored locally on your computer and then submitted for approval and publishing. To learn how to set up your local repo, see [Set up your local repository](contribute-get-started-setup-local.md).
