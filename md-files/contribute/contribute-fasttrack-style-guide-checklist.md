# FastTrack Style Guide

## Checklist

Use this checklist for best practices whenever you write or review FastTrack content.

[**General, overall**](contribute-fasttrack-style-guide-general-guidelines.md)

- Write out precisely and consistently all product, solution, or offering names.
- Don’t create abbreviations or acronyms out of any product name, service name, or trademark.
- Don’t use words that make or imply promises.
- Never write *Microsoft’s* (meaning *Microsoft is*).
- Avoid jargon, slang, idioms, and colloquiums.
- Be careful that your writing is bias-free. 
- Never embed text in a graphic or image. 
- Use Segoe font.
- Use sentence-style capitalization: everything is lowercase except proper nouns and the first word of a sentence, heading, title, UI label, list, or stand-alone phrase. 
- Use title-style capitalization (capitalizing most words) only for book and song titles; article titles in citations; titles of specific individuals.
- Place keywords up front in headings, paragraphs, sentences.
- Avoid using ampersand or plus symbols (&, +).

[**Voice, tense**](contribute-fasttrack-style-guide-tone-style.md)

- Use active voice rather than passive voice whenever you can. 
- Write in the present tense. 
- In general, use second person. 

[**Headings**](contribute-fasttrack-style-guide-tone-style.md#headings)

- Keep headings as short as possible but keep *a*, *the*, *that*, and verbs for translation.
- Capitalize only the first word (and proper nouns) in a heading.
- Don’t include punctuation at the end of a heading.
- Avoid using ampersands or plus symbols (&, +) in a heading.
- Use parallel construction for headings at the same level. 

[**Paragraphs, sentences, words, phrases**](contribute-fasttrack-style-guide-tone-style.md#sentence-structure)

- Use simple sentence structure. Break down the thoughts into small pieces. Put parenthetical information in a separate sentence. Don’t use long, compound, or complex sentences. 
- Write complete sentences. Include pronouns like that and who. Include articles like the, a, an. 
- Be consistent in your word choice. Use just one term for the same thing in all of the content.
- Use only the most common contractions, and don’t mix contractions and the spelled out version in the same content.
- Avoid Latin and other non-English words.
- Use only the abbreviations specified in the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net/StyleGuide/Read?id=2700) **A-Z word list and terms collections** section. 

[**Punctuation**](contribute-fasttrack-style-guide-general-guidelines.md#punctuation)

- Use only one space after periods, question marks, exclamation points, and colons.
- Don’t use end punctuation on headings, titles, subhead, and UI titles.
- Include commas after every item in a series, including the last one.
- Use only one space after a period, question mark, exclamation mark, or colon.
- Use a slash (/) to imply a combination (*on/off switch*). However, don’t use a slash to indicate a choice or as a substitute for *or*. Don’t use *and/or*.

[**Numbers, dates, and times**](contribute-fasttrack-style-guide-general-guidelines.md#numerals)

- In body text, spell out whole numbers zero to nine. Use numerals for 10 and above.
- Use appropriate terms and formats for dates, times, and seasons of the year.
