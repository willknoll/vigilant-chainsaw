# CXPBP tab

## Overview

The CXPBP tab is a URL that opens the current customerâ€™s information in the CXP Business portal. The CXPBP displays the tenant health report, usage, products, seat usage by workload, and a list of support cases opened in the last 6 months.

The cxpbp tab includes hover-over text that gives insight to the tab before clicking:  
**Review tenant level health reports that include health scores, monthly seat status, FTC assignments, service issues (if applicable), etc.**

> [!NOTE]
> The CXP Business Portal is outside of FTOP, for access please email <o365cxpteam@microsoft.com>.

## Next steps
