# Tenant View

## Overview

Tenant View is the primary way to view and access tenant information in FTOP. Use this view to identify inactive tenants where you should take an action to follow up with the customer. The screen consists of a customer/tenant grid with filterable information. The default view displays the Scorecard Adoption for active tenants that are assigned to you (My Active Tenants filter).

From Tenant View, you can view a summary of a tenants or if you want to zoom in to see a detailed view of a tenant, see section [**Detailed Tenant View**](detailed-tenant-view.md).
