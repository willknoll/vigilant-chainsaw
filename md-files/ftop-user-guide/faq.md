# FAQ

## Overview

### COVID-19 information

**Question**: Where can I find information about COVID-19?

**Answer**: See the [COVID-19 Response Playbook](../playbook/covid-resources.md).

### No access to FTOP

**Question**: I do not have access to FTOP. I get an error whenever I try to access it. What should I do?

**Answer**: Microsoft recommends that you also request access through [MyAccess](https://MyAccess). This will ensure that you have uninterrupted access when FTOP transitions to using MyAccess. For more information on how to obtain access to FTOP, see the FTOP User Access Guide.

### No tenants in Tenant View

**Question**: I don’t not see any tenants in Tenant View. What should I do?

**Answer**: Check the filter that is being used. The *My Active Tenants* filter should be the default view and should show any active tenants that are assigned to you.

If the filter is being used, you may not have any active tenants assigned to you. To see if you have any tenants assigned, try changing to the *My Tenants* view to see if any tenants appear.

If you still do not see any tenants, then you are likely not assigned to any tenants and should reach out to your team lead for assistance. Or you are not assigned to a security group that grants you permission to tenant data. You should reach out to your team lead to ensure proper security group membership.

### No filters display in Tenant View

**Question**: I don’t not see any filters in Tenant View. What should I do?

**Answer**: You are likely not assigned to a security group that grants you permission to tenant data. You should reach out to your team lead for assistance.

### Need help managing tenants

**Question**: Who should I escalate to if I am not assigned to a tenant that I believe I should be assigned to.

**Answer**: Escalate to the Assignment Team or your team lead.

### Need to check FTOP notes to see what has been done

**Question**: If someone is sick or on vacation and I cover a customer for them and want to check FTOP notes to see what has been done previously, and who the FE is. How can I now do this?

**Answer**: Reach out to your team lead or have the FM who is tenant primary assign you to their tenants to provide visibility.

### Need help obtaining customer data

**Question**: Account teams will often ask me to look up a customer and put them in contact with the assigned FM/FE. If I can no longer see this information what should I do?

**Answer**: The FM can ask his or her Team Manager to look up the FM information and provide it.  

**Question**: How do I check multiple tenants for the same customer if I am not assigned to all of them?

**Answer**: The FM can ask his or her Team Manager to look up the FM information and provide it.  

### Cannot access Usage or Analytics tabs

**Question**: I have access to FTOP but cannot access the Usage or Analytics tabs.

**Answer**: The Usage and Analytics tabs are hosted on Power BI. As such, an additional level of access is required.

After you obtain access to FTOP, you must join the *[FastTrack Power BI](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FastTrackPowerBI)* modern group.

### Consumption Notifications

**Question**: I receive Consumption Notification emails.  What are they and what action should I take?

**Answer**: The purpose of the FastTrack Consumption Notifications is to drive awareness to Account and Premier teams when their assigned M365 customer is unresponsive, or a targeted Modern Workplace service load is blocked or has not intent for over 30 days.   Partnering with the Account Technology Specialist (ATS) or Technical Account Manager (TAM) to resolve deployment blockers or verify the customer’s intent are the appropriate courses of action and should be documented according to the Services tab (L1) instructions as noted in [Consumption (L1) statuses](detailed-tenant-view-services-tab.md#comsumption-l1-status).
