# Compete

## Overview

The compete section is available in the Customer View to display customer compete signals. Compete signals are gathered from publicly available sources or from account team insights to determine if a customer may be using a competitor's product in test or production.

If an FM or FTA has any supporting knowledge of a compete signal, they can qualify the validity of the signal based on insight and provide details of the product in use based on conversations with the account team or general knowledge.

>[!NOTE]
>**FastTrack Managers and FastTrack Architects**: When having conversations with your customers, **do not** discuss how alerts are captured by Microsoft and FastTrack. During discussions, our recommendation is to determine if a specific workload is in scope, if that workload is not in scope and the customer highlights they are looking at competitor products, inquire to what competitor product it is to gain further insights.
