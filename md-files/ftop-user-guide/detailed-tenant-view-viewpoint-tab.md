# ViewPoint tab

## Overview

The ViewPoint tab is a URL that opens the current customerâ€™s tenant information in the ViewPoint portal. Viewpoint displays service health, tenant info and other useful tools. Use ViewPoint to access customer information such as customer location, domains, subscriptions, and administrators.

### Using ViewPoint

The viewpoint tab includes hover-over text that gives insight to the tab before clicking:
