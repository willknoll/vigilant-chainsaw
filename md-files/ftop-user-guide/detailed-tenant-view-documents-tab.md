# Documents tab

## Overview

The documents tab of the customer detailed view is a SharePoint documents library that stores documentation relevant for the customer/tenant. Examples of documents stored here include emails, customer onboarding plans, deployment checklists or OneNote files to track meetings and conversations.

The documents tab includes hover-over text that gives insight to the tab before clicking: **Create and review OneNoteâ€™s related to this customer. You will only see this tab if you are assigned to the customer. (For internal FTC use only)**

> [!NOTE]
> The documents library is not automatically generated. When the documents tab is clicked for the first time a dialog appears and you can create the library.

## Next steps

To learn about the next tab, see the [**CSPBP tab**](detailed-tenant-view-cxpbp-tab.md).
