# Partners tab

## Overview

The Partners tab is rarely used and would, when relevant, contain partner (company) information.

> [!NOTE]
> This should not be confused with the partner section under Contacts. Partners in this section are the company. Partners in the Contact section are individuals that work for the partner company/companies.
