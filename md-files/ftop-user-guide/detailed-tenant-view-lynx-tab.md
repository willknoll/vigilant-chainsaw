# Lynx tab

## Overview

The lynx tab directs you to a [**Lynx**](https://lynx.office.net) screen, which displays similar information as displayed on other screens, only in a slightly different format. If you are not assigned any tenants, the screen displays no results. Below is an example of entering either the GUID, Domain, Email, PUID, or Incident ID will load that specific page for that tenant.

The lynx tab includes hover-over text that gives insight to the tab before clicking:  

Access customer information regarding domains, caretaker information, subscriptions, service configuration, and support history.
