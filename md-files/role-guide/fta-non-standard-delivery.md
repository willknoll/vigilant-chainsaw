# FastTrack Non-standard Delivery Program

## Overview

During an engagement, the situation may arise that a customer requires
or desires additional scope that would typically fall outside of
standard FastTrack (FT) benefit and either for that scope to be included
or delivered by a partner.

Characteristically we align customer to the standard FT benefit.
However, in certain scenarios, FT may consider to either fund or approve
requests that are in the interest of the overall Microsoft motion and
the engagement to support outcomes -- including non-standard deliverables.
These would always require relevant approvals.

Delivery of these non-standard deliverables would not necessarily be
executed by FastTrack; FT with Senior Leadership Team (SLT) approval may
choose to engage a delivery partner to do it on behalf of FastTrack but
will still have Microsoft oversight.

Scenarios with outcomes that might require additional approval include,
but are not limited to, the following:

  - Save time or accelerate consumption.

  - Assist in the removal of a blocker (technical, organizational or
    financial).

  - Reducing or right-sizing costs (not only to customers, but also to
    Microsoft). For example: End Customer Investment Funds (ECIF) are
    requested.

  - Improve the overall Microsoft position in compete scenarios.

  - Overall solution requires inclusion and delivery of preview or
    roadmap items prior General Availability (GA).

  - Commitment upfront to diffuse misalignment.

  - Outcome agreed based on an outcome

FastTrack Manager (FM) should route "reasonable" requests to the
FastTrack Architect (FTA), if attached. When in doubt, contact the FTA
Area liaison by Teams or email for guidance. The FastTrack Architect
will then triage whether and provide input to determine best next steps
or if such a request is likely to be accepted or declined before
progressing any further.

## Assumptions

The FastTrack Manager and FastTrack Architect have a good
understanding of the customer situation and context to raise the
request and can substantiate and justify the requirement for the
delivery of the non-standard scope item(s).

## Process

### Request Non-standard Delivery 

#### Define the need for non-standard delivery

For every non-standard delivery request, the FastTrack Manager should
try to quantify the reason(s) or describe how approval would help the
overall FastTrack engagement. Questions which help do that are:

  - What are we attempting to achieve with an approval and what is the
    desired outcome?

  - What is the expected Active Usage (AU) growth and what is the
    estimated timeline?

  - What is the cost and how much effort is required for delivery?

  - What is the likelihood of the customer choosing a competitor?

  - What is the impact of not approving this request?



#### Raise an exception request

The FastTrack Manager should raise a request via [FTA
Portal](http://aka.ms/ftaportal) for triage and processing. If you
need assistance, please contact your area liaison FTA by Teams or email.

### Triage Non-standard Delivery Requests

#### Route request to the FastTrack Architect area liaison

Based on the area the engagement is delivered, the request will be
routed to the FastTrack Architect area liaison by default with CXP
regional support and approval. In case of absence, the FastTrack
Architect in the area must ensure a backup is in place.

#### Triage the requests

The FastTrack Architect will triage each request in their area. If
more information is required, the FTA will contact and consult the
assigned FastTrack Manager.

When in doubt, the FastTrack Architect will consult other FTAs who
have experience with the delivery of similar requests or scope items. For
example: there are ring-fenced FTAs in the Switcher program to help
customers switch from Google to Microsoft 365. Other FTAs may have
contacts in specific Product Groups or similar experience delivering
on certain preview programs.

Any request that a FastTrack Architect intends to approve which
includes funding, involving a partner, or a considerable amount of
effort, review the request and the recommendation by the FastTrack
Architect regional director.

### Build Deal for Non-standard Delivery

#### Build a deal

When the delivery is proposed to be executed by a partner (including
but not limited to Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS)), follow the
steps below to build a deal.

> [!NOTE] 
> Please note that during the review, including the process to
> support, it is important that we do NOT provide commitment to internal
> stakeholders or to the customer, until the CXP Leadership Team (LT)
> have approved as the request for scope increase or funding may be
> declined\!

1.  Contact the account team and discuss the scope of delivery.

2.  Have the account team select one or multiple partners.

3.  Ask the account team to request appropriate artifacts.

4.  Get ready to submit a request for ECIF.  The FastTrack architect will
    review the artifacts received and determine whether all required
    documents/information are in place.
      - Statement of Work (SOW)
      - Cost breakdown
      - Work breakdown structure (WBS)
      - Link to OneAsk URL
      - Any additional collateral

5.  Request the account team to submit a request for ECIF through the Digital Winroom (DWR).

6.  Advise the account team to submit a request to the [FTA
    Portal](http://aka.ms/ftaportal)

#### Build a program

For approved requests to deliver non-standard scope items, the
FastTrack Architect will discuss and agree with the assigned FastTrack
team the roles and responsibilities, including estimated effort and
Rhythm of Business (ROB) required. The FTA will also determine whether
the required skillset is present or whether there is a need to include
a subject matter expert (SME). Should the scenario require additional
oversight, an FTA will be attached (for a limited period) to offer
consulting and guidance to help deliver the program.

When dealing with preview programs, the FastTrack Architect will
liaise with and consult the Program Manager (PM) in the respective
product group responsible for the program to obtain additional
information (including terms and conditions) to help build the
program. The same applies to incubation or preview offerings run within
CXP by Product Group (PG) PM teams.

## Success Criteria

  - All requests are logged via [FTA Portal](http://aka.ms/ftaportal)

  - The request for non-standard delivery was triaged, reviewed and
    either declined or approved

  - Outcomes were agreed and described is achieved (Customer selected
    Microsoft, Unblocks, diffuses a situation, Usage increase or
    accelerated deployment
