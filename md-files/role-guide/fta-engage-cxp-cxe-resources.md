# Customer Health - How to Engage CXP/CXE Resources

## Overview

Enable FastTrack to act as a central escalation point for key CXP/CXE
teams focused on Microsoft 365 deployment assistance.

In FY20, **S500** field teams will be instructed to work with their
**FastTrack Architect** (FTA) when they need engineering specialists to
assist with deployment.

This document explains which CXP/CXE teams are in scope and how to
engage those teams.

## Objectives

FTAs are required to understand the following:

  - What are the CXP/CXE teams in scope?

  - Who is the lead from each team in case escalation and/or urgent
    responses are required?

  - How each team is engaged (proactively vs. reactively)?

  - What are the workloads in scope for each team?

## Approach

Primary Role: **FastTrack Architect**

The following table summarizes the CXP/CXE teams in scope and how to
engage them.

### FastTrack PM team

In addition to the CXP/CXE teams listed above, FastTrack Architects can
also directly contact the FastTrack workload PMs for assistance as
needed.

The detailed list of FastTrack PMs is currently being tracked in the
[FY20 Roles Responsibilities
deck](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/teams/FastTrackChangeManagement/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE617A99C-6874-477F-9209-5233E103AAA1%7D&file=FY20%20Roles%20Responsibilities.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&wdLOR=cAC2B0358-7574-42CF-A40E-B3A954D0E062&cid=bb7de9c5-dcd9-44bc-bfa6-59cb6de4c596).
If you have any permission issues accessing the deck, please contact
David Epand or Mike Grafham.

### 

### Out of Scope

Requests not directly related to deployment assistance such as technical
support and service incidents should continue to be managed via our
established support channels.

[http://gethelp](http://gethelp) continues to be the central point of escalation for all
general requests from the field.

## Key Inputs

  - Customer is part of the S500.

    response.

  - [Land the Benefit](../playbook/initiate-land-the-benefit.md) completed.

  - [Conduct Customer Kickoff](../playbook/initiate-conduct-customer-kick-off.md) completed.

## Key Outputs

    steps have been agreed.
