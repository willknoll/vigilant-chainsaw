# FTC Escalation Process

The FTC escalation process enables FMs and FEs to submit a FTC Help ticket using the web submission form in the Office 365 CXP Portal via [ftchelp](https://aka.ms/ftchelp).

When creating a ticket, please include as much relevant detail as possible. Please take the time to properly categorize your request to ensure expedited ticket routing.
