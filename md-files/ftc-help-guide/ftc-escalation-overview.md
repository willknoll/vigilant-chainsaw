## FTC Help SLA

Tickets will generally be assigned within 48 business hours of submission. If your request is time sensitive, contact your POD lead to review it.

## Responsibilities

Submitters are responsible for creating the initial ticket in the Office 365 CXP Portal with all necessary information. The initial case owner will review the case and will either resolve the ticket or pass it along to the correct team for further investigation.

### Submitters

Submitters are required to use the Office 365 CXP Portal web submission form to create FTC tickets. Itâ€™s important to include any screen shots and repro steps taken to clarify the request. Incomplete tickets will be sent back to the Submitter for missing information and may take additional time to process. There are no specific Priority levels in the submission form. Submitters must use the ticket details field to indicate if a request is high priority.

Submitters are expected to regularly check on the status of their tickets and respond to Actions or Comments as requested by the FTC Help Triage team.

## FTC Help Ticket Escalations

If your ticket was not properly addressed and you would like to escalate; please email ftchelpsupport@microsoft.com with subject FTC Help Escalation Support Request.  Please include the ticket number and the reason you feel that your ticket was not handled appropriately.  The FTC Help PM will investigate the matter and follow up with you shortly afterwards.
