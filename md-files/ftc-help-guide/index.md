## Introduction

FTC Help is an escalation point for FMs and FEs to submit tickets for break/fix related issues specific to FastTrack processes and tools.  In most cases, the requests submitted to FTC Help should be focused on addressing a single customer related issue where a tool/process needs immediate attention and may not be functioning as expected.

FTC Help is also used to request changes to a tenant Engagement Scenario.
