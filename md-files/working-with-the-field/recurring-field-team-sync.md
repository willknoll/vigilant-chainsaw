# Recurring Field Team Sync

## Active Customers (Assess -> Migrate)

1. Recurring suggested timeline: Discuss with your Field team. Many are bi-weekly or monthly. Some may need to be weekly.

2. Regular sync with Health (S1500)/RFA/Targeted customers to provide your status updates and status timelines with account team and make sure everyone is on the same page.

>[!NOTE]
>If you foresee an issue, let the account team know so it can be addressed before it escalates (Do not wait until status call).

Example Scenarios: Deployment timeline seems longer/slower than you would expect, if things are not going according to plan â€“ speak up!

3. Provide Account team any customer asks that are not covered by FastTrack.

4. Quarterly: Validate Health forecasts and compete scenarios in play.

5. Verify renewals or upsell opportunities when applicable.

6. Educate on new FTC offerings (if applicable).

7. Follow up with meeting overview notes.

## Inactive Health Customers

1. Regular sync with Health (S1500) customers to get a status update on customer.

2. Review blocked and no intent reasons to be sure they still apply.

3. Validate that FastTrack has been positioned to the customer and are aware of the support we can provide.

4. Validate Health forecasts and compete scenarios in play.

5. Verify renewals or upsells opportunities when applicable.

6. Educate on new FTC offerings (if applicable).
