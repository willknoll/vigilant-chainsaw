# How to find your field contacts

In FTOP, we have a section called Contacts. Updated Account Team members should be included in this section. If not up to date, or does not include all Field Team members, use the CALC tool. Review the Privacy section below to review what we can share with our Field Teams.

We also have a tool called CALC with the latest account team information.

1. Navigate to https://calc.microsoft.com/

2. Select **Account Management**.

4. Select customer from the results page.

5. Click TEAM section.
