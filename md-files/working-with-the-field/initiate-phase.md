# Initiate Phase

## Prep before Account team call

1. For RFA, review details around the request for support.

2. For Health, look at the usage reports to determine what areas are red and need work.

    a. Determine if there is a FastTrack Architect aligned and partner with them on all syncs (determine who is leading what)

3. Get basic background about the company.

## Send the internal invite

1. Make sure to include all account team resources on an intro email.

2. Ensure calendar availability is open for key players. Make you sure validate who the key players are in your intro email to account team (ie -MANDATORY: ATS, TAM; OPTIONAL: AE, CSM, TSP, SSP, ADE).

3. Include an agenda in the invite.

    a. Intro

        i. FastTrack Process (Validate Field team understanding)

    b. Educate on new FTC offerings, current offerings (service description), and internal motions and approaches in FastTrack if required

    c. Validate intent (either Health or RFA Workloads)

        ii. Obtain reasons for why workloads are blocked/no intent

    d. Environment Background

    e. Confirm licenses

    f. Any compete/3rd party products in play?

    g. Migration source environment?

    h. Partner or FastTrack Ready Partner engaged?

    i. Additional tenants that you need to be aware of? (For Health customers)

    j. Organization org chart available for the people FastTrack will be working with? (Role and MSFT Technology owned)

    k. Any political changes at the customer

    l. Timeline/Risks/current issues

    m. Asks

    n. Determine Internal Field Team syncing rhythm for active projects (Is there one already occurring in the Field that you can join? Schedule a new one.)

## Account team sync

1. Follow up Agenda.

    a. Ask: Email intro to the customer

    b. Ask [Optional]: Join dedicate Teams Channel/Teams group to discuss support activity

    c. Follow up with email on summary, any open items, and determine next steps

    d. Document summary and next steps in FTOP

    e. Schedule/ask for Invite Internal syncing rhythm with Field Team
