# Automated Onboarding Assistance

The FastTrack team offers automated onboarding assistance on FastTrack-eligible services through a set of bots and wizards that augment traditional onboarding with on-demand tools for customers with limited direct FastTrack engagement. This includes email support for wizards that allow customers to help themselves and still request personal assistance from reactive owners, which may be escalated for issues in the proactive effort. Once an issue is addressed, the customer reverts to a reactive effort.

The **Assess** Phase gathers information on the customer’s infrastructure and goals, per workload to help customers understand the benefit to their organization and create a remediation plan. The **Remediate** Phase resolves any issues identified in the Assess Phase by addressing technical gaps to remediate using the Remediation Checklist to help the customer ensure their environment is ready to enable services. The **Enable** Phase enables services the customer will adopt such as custom domains, network configuration, identity integration and authentication that allows the FastTrack team to provision and enable each service. Once enabled, data migration begins when in scope.

FastTrack Eligible Services include:

  - Exchange Online
  - SharePoint Online
  - OneDrive for Business
  - Office ProPlus
  - Microsoft Teams
  - Skype for Business Online
  - Yammer
  - Project Online
  - Power Business intelligence (BI)
  - StaffHub

The Automated Onboarding Model process flow is depicted as follows:

1.  Access → Conduct Technical Assessment → Conduct Services Workshops
2.  Remediate → Address Technical Gaps
3.  Enable → Enable Services → Migrate Data
