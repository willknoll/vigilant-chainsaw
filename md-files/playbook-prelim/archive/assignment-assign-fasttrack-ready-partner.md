# Assign FastTrack Ready Partner

Program Manager: **Rosie Arrieta**  
Phase: **Assignment**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Assign FastTrack Ready Partner process is how FastTrack assigns
customers to a partner. Once a customer is FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP)
eligible, a required assessment is conducted to ensure we identify and
assign a qualified partner to enable an excellent customer experience
and notify the customer. 

## Objectives

  - Refer FRP-eligible customers to an appropriate FRP based on eligible
    workloads, language, location and/or Round Robin criteria.
  - Customers ineligible for referral to an FRP are assigned to the
    appropriate Customer Support Service (CSS) regional queue.

## Approach

### Determine Appropriate Partner

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Applies To: **Core Onboarding**

Using [Partner
Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/solution-providers/search?customFilters=curatedlists%2cfasttrack),
determine appropriate FRP for the referral based on eligible workloads,
language, location and/or Round Robin assignment.
