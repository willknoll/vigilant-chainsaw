# Validate Request for Assistance (RFA)

Program Manager: **Maria Conceição**  
Phase: **Validation**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

Customers and Account Teams can request assistance from FastTrack using
the FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP). The Request for Assistance
(RFA) form is found on the [FastTrack
Portal](https://fasttrack.microsoft.com/).

## Objectives

  - Review RFA submissions to determine if the tenant meets FTC
    eligibility criteria.
  - Respond to the requestor of the RFA and let them know if their
    request was approved, rejected of additional information is needed.
  - If the tenant is already in FTOP, provide the FastTrack Manager (FM)
    with the RFA details.  If the tenant is not in FTOP, assign it to
    the Validation and Engagement queues so the tenant can be updated
    and assigned to Microsoft Delivery or FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP).
