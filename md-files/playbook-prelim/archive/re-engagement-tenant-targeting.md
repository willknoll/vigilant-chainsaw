# Tenant Targeting

Program Manager: **Maria Conceição**  
Phase: **Re-Engagement**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Tenant Targeting process identifies which customer the Gateway
Re-Engagement Team (GRT) services next. Following a series of
validations and business rules, each tenant is numerically scored, then
ordered by score and assigned a Re-engagement FastTrack Manager (FM)
using a top down approach.

## Objectives

Score all tenants to maximize active usage (AU) potential during
customer outreach.

## Approach

### Agree on List

Primary Role: **Workload PM**  
Applies To: **All Services**

The workload Program Manager (PM) and GRT team agree on the customer
list for a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) based on business rules
defined by each DRI.

### Provide Engagement Playbook

Primary Role: **Workload PM**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Provide customer list and engagement playbook to use.

### Validate Tenant (Tenant Targeting)

Primary Role: **Re-engagement PM**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Validate list again the following rules:

  - Customer seat size larger than 1k and below 50k
  - Customer not assigned to FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP)
  - Customer not actively been worked on by Customer Support Service
    (CSS)
  - Customer is not actively been worked by Incubation Team
  - Customer is not actively been worked by Enterprise Mobility +
    Security (EMS) Team
  - Customer is not S400

Verify if customer is S400 consult:

  - FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP) porftolio view search for
    Top400FY19

OR

  - Use [Waves](http://aka.ms/ftcwaves) Power Business Intelligence
    (PBI)

### Tenant Tagging

Primary Role: **Re-engagement PM**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Tenants (customers) who match validation criteria are tagged by the
reporting team with:

  - Tenant-level tag = FY9-Reengagement
  - Workload-level tag = FY19-Reengagement-\<wave name\>

Non-actionable tenants (i.e., failed validation) are communicated
to each Workload PM and the Re-engagement PM must:

  - Add himself as FM to each tenant.  
  - Capture disengagement notes in FTOP.
  - Reason: Disengaged in GRT Validation.
  - Proceed to the \[\[[GRT
    Disengaged​](./re-engagement-team-disengaged.md)\]\]
    process.

### Consolidate Lists

Primary Role: **Re-engagement PM**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Consolidate lists to identify overlaps (i.e., tenants in 2 or more
lists) for customers with a higher priority.

### Prioritize Tenants

Primary Role: **Automation**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Prioritize tenants using business rules that include, but are not
limited to:

  - Managed versus Unmanaged
  - Previous experience with FastTrack Center (FTC)
  - New Customer
  - Renewal
  - TripWire
  - AU Potential

### GRT FM Assignment

Primary Role: **Re-engagement PM**  
Applies To: **All Services**

GRT PM uses a set of rules to identify a FM to assign for each tenant
using the following rules starting with higher score tenants (each
tenant has a score):

  - Assignment per region
  - FM capacity and skill
  - Tenant size
  - Tenant country
  - Tenant required language

After FM is identified, the FM must:

  - Email FM with customer assignment details (Tenant ID, Customer name,
    etc.)
