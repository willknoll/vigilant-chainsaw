# Engagement Management Notes Guidance  

[!INCLUDE [COVID Guidance](./includes/playbook-covid-guidance.md)]  

Primary Role: **FastTrack Manager**  
Applies To: **All Services**  

## Objectives

There are three types of notes which should be used by the FM roles: [Engagement Management Notes](guidance-fm-engagement-management-notes.md), [Enterprise Status Notes](guidance-enterprise-status-notes.md), and [Service Intent Notes](status-guidance-service-intent-notes.md). This guidance details the expectations placed on the FMs (and certain SME teams) pertaining to the frequency, and the Engagement Management Note's content and format. Enterprise Status Notes are only to be used by Health Owners (FMs and FTAs accountable for the health of the S1500) on the winner tenant.  

## Frequency  

These updates should be added after a call or email exchange with the customer/account team/partner where there is information of a note that is worth tracking because it helps document the customer journey through FastTrack, helps management understand and assess progress, and documents next actions. Example of notes taken during a customer meeting:  

1. Sync meeting with customer to review Q&A, assist with configuration issues on following:  

   - Skype to Teams: customer observed some inconsistencies with users' ability to share video and screens. Reviewed several user accounts who had reported issues and found that a Meeting policy change was needed (to apply Global/default policy) to users who reported issues.  
   - Action: FE will investigate expected user experience and report back to customer accordingly with supporting documentation as needed/available.  

2. Talked through Teams Policies with the customer. We walked through meeting and messaging policies. Also spent time talking through co-ex policies and how to utilize them.  

   - They currently have about 300 users that need to move to Teams only.  
   - The rest of their organization ~1500 is feeling the pain of being in islands mode while having some folks in Teams only.  
   - Their intention is to move all users to Teams only early 2020. Also, they have an ask around being able to Teams enable an O365 group and having all of the existing folder structure moved over.  

3. Infrastructure request is complete. Once build is ready, need to create the connector with the third vendor Super Admin and O365 Global Admin. Discussed Conditional Access which is turned on for O365. User Mapping file is needed prior to Test/Pilot Migrations. We reviewed initial inventory report to identify probable issues, drive/file sizes, etc.  
  Action: Once FTC Help Ticket is resolved, add additional 300 users to migration forecast.  

4. Internal sync with FTA, CSM, SME to determine FastTrack + PG + ATU + Partner ECIF approach to provide strategies around. Deployment Guidance, MDM Configuration, IT Support Readiness, End User ACM.  
  Action: Support ongoing internal/customer syncs. FTA to propose next steps to engage customer and other internal stakeholders.  

5. Internal Sync with New ATS  
Driving new Teams push with the customer. Has requested FTC plug into his effort. They have about 24K users on Teams and starting to discuss a larger drive for adoption and we would like to make sure that we are preparing them properly for any large-scale rollout in the following areas.  

   - Network and Infrastructure  
   - Endpoints readiness  
   - Security (conditional access), legal and compliance/ e-discovery  
   - Adoption / Service readiness (Handled by the CSM)  
Action: Support customer meeting on March 30th, 2020.  
6. Walked through the RCL for the hybrid pre-requirements, customer confirmed all domains are verified in O365 except one possible domain.  

   - FM to send article on EX2016 to EXO about oversized mailboxes and mailbox growth after migration.
   - Migration is going well; migration adjacent issues are looming; ~1300 mailboxes have been migrated
   - Customer needs to know how to deal with terminated SfBO accounts. 
   - Customer requested ideal functionality to be able to create the account and have the account be created in SfBO with the correct AD attributes on-premises without having to create the account on premise and migrate it to the cloud.  

## Note Templates  

As part of the launch of the New Notes Library, in-tool templates are now available by note category.   A new note template has been introduced to the Engagement Management note category.  In the future, there will be additional templates available for use.  The templates are meant to provide a guided experience for the relevant information to capture.  However, they are not required (unless specific instructions or a process have made the request to leverage a template.)  Below is an example of a template that is available directly from the Notes Editor within the Engagement Management Note category.  

**Participants:**

**Discussion points:** *What topics were discussed during the call*

**Customer questions:**

**FTC actions:** *What information did the FM/FE/SME share or demo during the call*

**Playbook task:** *Task label i.e. Kickoff Call*
