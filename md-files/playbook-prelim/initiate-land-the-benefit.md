# Land the Benefit

Phase: **Initiate**  
Motions: **Customer Health**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

Landing the Enterprise FastTrack Benefit means informing all
stakeholders about what to expect of the FastTrack team delivering the
benefit. FastTrack Architects assigned to the customer is accountable
for Landing the Enterprise Benefit. The main purpose of the Land the
Benefit discussion is to set the right expectations and help ensure
every stakeholder understands the FastTrack responsibilities and those
of the customer. Landing the Benefit is a core element of managing
customer and partner satisfaction throughout the FastTrack engagement as
well as identifying scope that would fall outside of the FastTrack
Benefit. The initial presentation needs to be delivered during the
pre-sales phase as per the “Customer Decision Framework” (CDF) by the
Pre-Sales FastTrack Architect. Often when there are new people joining
the customer project team, customer is starting to onboard a new set of
services or when there are changes to the scope of the FastTrack
Benefit, the FastTrack in delivery will be required to re-deliver the
“Land the Benefit session” again.​  

## Objectives

The FastTrack Architect presents and facilitates a conversation to
achieve the following:

  - FastTrack Benefit in included in Microsoft 365 subscription and
    comes with no additional costs to the customer  
  - FastTrack represents the best practices for moving to the cloud,
    based on Microsoft experiences working with over 70,000 customers in
    the last 10+ years
  - FastTrack helps customers with technical onboarding and data
    migration
  - FastTrack is available to the customer for as long as they have an
    active subscription for example if the customer wants to onboard
    another workload at a later date
  - Customers that are eligible for the Enterprise Benefit understand
    the scope and advantages that this program provides
  - Additional scope has been planned and documented and agreed with
    accompanying necessary exception approvals where required​  

  

## Approach

Motions: **Customer Health**  
Applies To: **All Services**

situation and need for the Land the Benefit presentation. Land the
benefit with the ATU, to ensure they understand the FastTrack Benefit
available to the customer, roles and responsibilities of the FastTrack
team/ customer and(or) partner Discuss and agree on who will schedule
the customer meeting. FTA is accountable for having the meeting

best positioned to schedule the meeting with the customer.

  

Please use the [FastTrack Enterprise Toolkit
folder​](https://aka.ms/FT-Enterprise-Toolkit) for this activity.​  

### Deliver and Land the Enterprise benefit with Customers and Partners

Primary Role: **FastTrack Architect v2**  
Motions: **Customer Health**  
Applies To: **All Services**

Meet the customer key stakeholders, such as the CIO and their Program
and Project Management team, as well as any partners involved in the
customer program, and give them a presentation on the FastTrack
Enterprise Benefit available to the customer. Convey the key messages
(see section “Key Messages” above) to set the scene and then dive deeper
to specific topics based on what the customer and partner have in scope
of their program. Ensure everybody understand the FastTrack delivery
model as well as the roles and responsibilities of every party involved.
When having the conversation with the customer, also take a note of
their DIBS and SSAT status.

  

  - Due Date, Intent, Business Reason and Sponsor (DIBS) are
    prerequisites to customer success. If any of these are not there, it
    poses a risk to the customer success going forward. Work with the
    customer to get DIBS in place, to mitigate the risk.
  - Stakeholders, Scenarios, Awareness and Training (SSAT) are enablers
    for the customer success, which usually need to be built during the
    engagement. Getting SSAT in place should be included in the plan and
    progress tracked in the Health Review meetings. If this is in
    pre-sales phase or just after the customer has purchased the
    subscription, also capture the customer’s desired engagement start
    date. This should be the date when the customer would like to start
    working with the FastTrack team.
