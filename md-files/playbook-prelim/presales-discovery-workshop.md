# Discovery Workshop
 
Phase: **PreSales**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Discovery Workshop process is a workshop to educate customers and
participating partners on the FastTrack benefit, the Microsoft 365
(M365) deployment process, and to determine deployment requirements.
Through discussion, the FastTrack Architect (FTA) and customer formulate
deployment priorities and identify key decisions to make or discuss more
deeply. Workshops are typically conducted at specific points during the
sales cycle or after a Land The Benefit workshop. Assistance
communicating the FastTrack benefit is available to all Microsoft
Services and Global Pursuit teams through FastTrack Center (FTC) Help at
[https://aka.ms/ftarequest](https://o365cxp.microsoftcrmportals.com/FTArequest/).

## Objectives

The FTA partners with an Account Team to conduct a discovery workshop
with the customer and:

  - Identify potential blockers preventing the customer from adopting
    the service.
  - Review FastTrack benefits to identify required work outside of the
    FastTrack scope. 
  - Qualify a customer for extended Enterprise benefit.
