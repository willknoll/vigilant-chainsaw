# Assign to Delivery

Phase: **Engagement**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**   
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Assign to Delivery process is how a new workload intent is created
and the Gateway Re-engagement Team (GRT) is ready to transition the
customer back to FastTrack delivery. 

## Objectives

  - Customer assigned to Delivery team.
  - Communicate GRT actions to date to FastTrack delivery to ensure
    customer activities are consistently moving forward.

## Approach

### Extended Engagement Start Date

Primary Role: **Targeting Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

When the FastTrack Center (FTC) Start Date is *more* than 30 days out:

  - Keep tenant in Intent FastTrack Manager (FM) Portfolio.
  - Track customer to ensure they are continually making progress.
  - Periodically engage with customer to ensure they are on track to
    engage with the FTC on the predetermined FTC Engagement Start date.
  - If customer decides to disengage, the GRT team disengages and
    captures notes (notes must start with "Re-engaged Customer") in
    FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP)​:
      - Reason: Customer declined
      - Proceed to the [GRT
        Disengaged](./engagement-re-engagement-team-disengaged.md)
        process.  

### Near-term Engagement Start Date

Primary Role: **Targeting Manager**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
Applies To: **All Services**

When the Engagement Start Date is *within* 30 days​​:

Add last over​all status note with **Re-engaged Customer** at the
beginning with the rest of the DIBS info as shown in the template
