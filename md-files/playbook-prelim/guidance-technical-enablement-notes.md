# Technical Enablement Notes Guidance

[!INCLUDE [COVID Guidance](./includes/playbook-covid-guidance.md)]  

Primary Role: **FastTrack Engineer; FastTrack Engineer SME**  
Applies To: **All Services**

## Objectives

FE and FE SME roles are required to record notes in the FastTrack Orchestration Portal (FTOP) throughout the duration of their customer engagements. Technical Enablement Notes are required to be recorded when delivering Technical Workshops, Remediation activities, Enablement activities and other ring-fence specific activities to capture technical status. This guidance details the expectations placed on the M365 FE/SME pertaining to the frequency, and the Technical Enablement Note's content and format.  

## Frequency

Notes must be recorded in FTOP each time an M365 FE/SME has an interaction with a customer, internal stakeholder, or undertakes an engagement related activity. Some examples of these interactions:  

- Kickoff meeting
- Technical Workshops
- Assess activities
- Remediation meetings and follow up actions
- Enablement meetings
- Testing or reproductions during customer deployment and related activities

## Notes Content and Format

As part of the launch of the New Notes Library, in-tool templates are now available by note category. Two new note templates have been introduced to the Technical Enablement note category. One note template was created for FEs and the other for SMEs. In the future, there will be additional templates available for use.  The templates are meant to provide a guided experience for the relevant information to capture. However, they are not required (unless specific instructions or a process have made the request to leverage a template.)  Below is an example of a template that is available directly from the Notes Editor within the Technical Enablement Note category.  

## FE Template:  

**Status:** *Brief summary statement on the status of the engagement.*

- *Examples â€“ On track, paused, pending customer feedback, pending FastTrack Center (FTC) or internal feedback*  

**Summary:** *Include a synopsis of activities undertaken during the interaction.*  

**Overall Concerns:** *Insert concerns here, where applicable.*  

## SME Template:  

**Status:** *Brief summary statement on the status of the engagement.*  

**Summary:** *Include a synopsis of activities undertaken during the interaction.*  

**Deployment Concerns:** *Insert concerns here, where applicable in relation to the long-term solution and implementation.*  

- *Examples:*  
  - *Details about the nature of the concern (1st party software, 3rd party software or hardware, business concern, security, project resources or funding).*
  - *Note: Where 1st party software concerns are identified, the corresponding FTC Insight ID must be referenced.*  

Other things to include in the notes not yet included as part of the template:  

**Next Steps:**  *Expected next steps to continue with the Technical Enablement phase.*  

## Example of a Note  

**Status:** On track to continue the deployment process and currently working on remediation checklist follow up actions.  

**Summary:** Remediation checklist work has been started by customer.  Customer is currently working through Exchange items.  Heavy discussion today on how certificates should be configured in Exchange Hybrid scenarios.  Walked through different mail flow options for Exchange Hybrid scenarios.  Discussed the importance of bypassing 3rd party mail appliances for mail flow scenarios.  

**Overall Concerns:** Customer is hesitant to bypass 3rd party Email filtering appliance.  

**Next Steps:** Customer to obtain and configure certificates in their Exchange environment.  After completion, we will meet with customer to run Hybrid Configuration Wizard.
