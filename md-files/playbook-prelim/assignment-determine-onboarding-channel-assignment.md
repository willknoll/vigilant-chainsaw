# Determine onboarding channel assignment

Phase: **Assignment**  
Motions: **RFA**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Determine Onboarding Channel process engages the Account Team,
Partner, and Customer to determine intent or reaching out after
processing the RFA. The Manager then identifies whether a tenant
qualifies to either be assigned to a Ready Partner or to Microsoft
delivery​ resources.  

## Objectives

  - ​Determine if the tenant meets the requirements for one of the
    onboarding channels
  - Complete the step for onboarding channel  

## Approach

### FastTrack Ready Partner (FRP) is Engaged

Primary Role: **RFA Manager**  
Motions: **RFA**  
Applies To: **Core Onboarding**

If a deployment partner is confirmed that they are already engaged from
communication with the Account Team, Partner or Customer,  check to see
if the partner is on the [FastTrack Ready Partner
List​](https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/49386223-5d87-4d95-abcf-a18667dbcdcd/ReportSection?ctid=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47).
If the partner is on the list, then the partner is considered a
“FastTrack Ready Partner”.  

  

Follow the current guidance to determine if the tenant meets FRP

If the tenant meets the requirements to be assigned to the FRP, then the

        and correct if necessary.
