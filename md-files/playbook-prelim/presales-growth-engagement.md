# Growth Engagement
 
Phase: **PreSales**  
Motions: **Customer Health / Targeting**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The Growth Engagement motion is a systematic and consistent set of processes to work with account teams at scale to influence upsell to E5 workloads. Through discussion, the FastTrack Architect (FTA) and account teams identify the FastTrack value proposition for customers upgrading to E5. Â 

## Objectives

As the FTC starts working closer with the account teams to influence upsell to E5, there is a need for us to refine the nature of our security positioning to customers. The objectives here are:  

- Introduce a formal task that defines a consistent interaction with account teams for E5 growth at scale.  
- Present the FastTrack perspective to the account teams on how we can partner together on E5 growth.  

## Approach
