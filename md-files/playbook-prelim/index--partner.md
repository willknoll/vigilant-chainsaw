## Engagement Models

One deployment option does not fit the diverse situations of Microsoft M365
customers. FastTrack utilizes multiple engagement models to best
support a customer’s cloud deployment journey. 

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible that a customer may engage in multiple models during their lifecycle.
>
> For example, Commercial Services Monthly Active Usage (**CSMAU**) model searches for customers that meet certain critera and then may utilize the processes from the **Re-engagement** model before passing that customer back to the **Proactive** model.

-   [Reactive Model](./model-reactive.md)

-   [Proactive Model](./model-proactive.md)

-   [Re-engagement Model](./model-re-engagement.md)

-   [Commercial Services Monthly Active Usage (CSMAU) Model](./commercial-services-usage.md)

-   [Enterprise/S400 Model](./enterprise-deploy-fasttrack-on-site.md)

-   [Service Specific Models](./service-specific.md)

## Customer Lifecycle

of phases can vary based on the engagement model.
