# Request FastTrack Subject Matter Expert (SME) Resources

## Determining Required SME Role

There are times during a FastTrack deployment that a Subject Matter
Expert (SME), now referred to as a FastTrack Specialist, is required to
provide deep technical and/or deployment guidance to the customer,
partner, FastTrack Manager, FastTrack Engineer, or the assigned
FastTrack team. Subject Matter Experts or Specialists have demonstrated
an expert level of knowledge in specific workload, core, or
security/compliance areas. A Subject Matter Expert can be requested
through the [FTC Resource Request Tool](https://aka.ms/FTCResourceRequest) and can include the following role
types:

  - **FastTrack Engineer SME** – a resource available to respond to more
    complex technical questions or complete workload specific deployment
    activities or tasks

  - **FastTrack Enterprise Resource** – a role type available at the
    time the request is submitted if an onsite need has been determined

  - **FastTrack Migration Resource** – a resource available to the
    Partner community to respond to migration planning questions


Additional information on all FastTrack roles, including skill levels,
can be found in the [FastTrack Role
Guide](../role-guide/index.md).

Scenarios and roles could include, but not be limited to:

| **SME Scenario**                                                      | **Role Required**             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Deployment Escalations for T1500 workloads                            | FastTrack Enterprise Resource |
| Confirmed Cloud Management, Intune “Cloud Attach” for Windows devices | FastTrack Engineer SME        |
| Security: Identity (AADP), Devices (Intune/MDATP), Information (EOP, DLP, AIP, OATP) Readiness Workshops delivery | FastTrack Engineer SME        |
| Intune Remediate, AIP, OATP, and MDATP Enable tasks | FastTrack Engineer SME        |
| Teams Transition Assess and Enable tasks                              | FastTrack Engineer SME        |
| Get Modern Assess tasks                                               | FastTrack Engineer SME        |
| Customer network design is incompatible with M365                     | FastTrack Engineer SME        |
| Partner requests assistance preparing customer migrations             | FastTrack Migration Resource  |
| FastTrack required to be at the customer’s site                       | FastTrack Enterprise Resource |

Requestor should work with the customer, partner, Account Team (if
available), and/or the assigned FastTrack team to determine the role
requirements and expectations prior to submitting the request.

> [!NOTE]
> FastTrack Enterprise role must be selected at the time the request is created in order to secure the SME to be on site. Justification for and approval of customer on-site presence is required for assignment, as well. Onsite Enterprise support is limited to FTC requests at this time.  Partner requests will apply to migration and technical support.

Refer to the FastTrack Playbook for additional process and task guidance
when identifying a SME need.

## Submitting a SME Request

The assigned FastTrack Architect, FastTrack Manager, Intent Manager, or
FastTrack Engineer can submit a SME request using the [FTC Resource Request Tool](https://aka.ms/FTCResourceRequest). Following the form instructions, complete the required fields, noting that certain workloads will require specific details to determine the “best fit” SME assignment. Incomplete or incorrect information will delay the process as the request will be returned to the requestor for additional details. The requestor will receive an email notification upon successful submission.

> [!NOTE]
> If a notification is not received, contact the FastTrack SME Assignment team at [ftsmeassign@microsoft.com](mailto:ftsmeassign@microsoft.com) for assistance.

## Tracking a SME Request

Request status can be monitored on the main page of the [FastTrack Resource Request Tool](https://aka.ms/FTCResourceRequest).
Email notifications will also be sent as the status is updated.

## Onboarding a SME

The requestor will receive notification with onboarding steps once a SME
is assigned by the CSS SME Assignment Lead, or the SME may reach out
directly. It is expected that the requestor will work with the SME to
define expectations (i.e. customer-facing guidance, FE shadowing, FTOP
task execution, etc.) and any pertinent criteria to release the SME once
the activities are complete.
