# End Customer Incentive Funds / Digital WinRoom Request Review
 
Phase: **PreSales**  
Motions: **Customer Health / RFA / Targeting**  
[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview

The End Customer Incentive Funds (ECIF) / Digital WinRoom (DWR) request
review process identifies how funds are allocated for specific qualified
programs to pay for services that benefit customers with demonstration,
deployment and usage of Microsoft products and solutions.  

  

A FastTrack Architect (FTA) review is requested for any scoped M365 ECIF
request that is USD 50,000$ or more. The FTA identifies work that may be
considered duplicative with FastTrack.  

  

DWR Review requests greater than USD 100,000$ will require more detailed
review by and possible direct customer discussion with the FastTrack
Architect. Additional DWR review guidance can be found at [DWR FastTrack
Guidance](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Digital_Win_Room/Pages/FastTrack-Guidance.aspx).
 

  

To learn more about qualifying criteria for ECIF requests effective July
1, 2018, visit [ECIF
Home](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/infopedia_g05/pages/ecif.aspx#Tab1).

  

## Objectives

The FTA partners with the Account Team to review the ECIF/DWR request
and determine any overlap with FastTrack provided capabilities and
appropriateness of the work proposed.  

## Approach

The following prerequisites should be available in English and reviewed

    is a customer ready document detailing the in scope work to be
    delivered as well as any out of scope activities 
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): estimated schedule with tasks and
    resources required to complete the SOW scope
  - Cost Breakdown: resource and materials costs as defined by the SOW
