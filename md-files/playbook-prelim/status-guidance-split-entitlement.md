# Split Entitlement Guidance
Entitlements can be split under the following approved scenarios:
 
- **Multiple geos** where a customer can deploy in one and not in the other.
    - Litware, Inc. has divisions in the United States (US) and France. The US Operations division plans to deploy SharePoint Online (SPO); however, the France division has cloud trust issues and therefore will not be deploying this service.
    - Contoso’s headquarters are in Canada with remote offices in Russia and Africa. Contoso has decided to deploy Skype for Business (SfB) for their headquarters employees but not for their remote offices due to lack of bandwidth.

- **Multiple operating companies or organizations** under one tenant that have different tenants for different workloads than the parent company.
    - Fabrikam is a division of Contoso and Contoso controls the tenant for Fabrikam. Fabrikam has intent to deploy SfB but Contoso has decided to deploy Teams.  
    - A government customer bought G3 licenses for all of their state departments in their tenant but not all departments have agreed to use all workloads. For example, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has intent to only deploy email and mobile device management. The Department of Interior has intent to only deploy SfB.
    - Contoso Pharmaceuticals is a division of Contoso Inc. and Contoso (5000 users) is the main tenant. Contoso Pharmaceuticals has 1000 users and they do not allow for data to be stored in the cloud due to security compliance issues and concerns. They will not be using SPO, OneDrive for Business (ODfB) and Teams. Their mailboxes will be kept on-premises in their hybrid Exchange setup.​
- Tenant purchased multiple bundled licenses or an upgraded subscription and they have **duplicated** entitlements (**Requires approval**).
