# Creation Process

Program Manager: **Maria Conceição**  
Phase: **Waves** 

[!INCLUDE [Data Privacy](./includes/playbook-data-privacy.md)]  

## Overview
The wave process describes all the elements necessary to generate a wave including the wave details, filtering requirements, playbook and training. Finally, we describe the Process to execute a wave and report progress.

## Objectives
Define the process to create a wave.

Primary Role: **Workload Program Manager**  
Applies To: **All Services**

## Approach 
**Define Re-Engagement Wave Elements**  
1. Define the required Re-Engagement wave elements. 
  - For every wave, the Workload PM must provide the following information:
    - Wave objectives
    - Wave target list (based on targeting criteria defined by the Workload PM)
    - Criteria for disengagement'
    - Success criteria
    - Expected timeline
    - Playbook
    - Playbook training for the FMs (2 slots one for EMEA and one for AMERICAS)  
  - Any specific wave reporting expectations 
  - Contact for questions and escalation

2. The re-engagement team has an additional set of filters that must be applied to the waves. Tenants that match any of the filters bellow will be excluded. 
Targeting filters:
  - Customer seat size is over 1k  
  - Customer seat size is less than 30k
  - Customer is not s400
  - Customer is not assigned to FRP
  - Customer is not actively been worked by CSS
  - Customer is not in Incubation
  - Customer is not worked by EMS team
  - Customer is not APJ
  - Oppty on the targeted workload is over Xk. X value to be agreed by Workload PM and GRT PM wave by wave.

3. For each wave, the workload PM must provide a Playbook. The Playbook elements are: 
  - Wave objectives
  - Guidance for talking to the ATU:
    - Any specific reach out email template
    - What is the best role to talk to (not all roles can provide same level of info)?
    - What specific information we need to get from the account team?
    - Which customer contact (role) do we want them to connect us to?
    - Any specific guidance on talking to the ATU in the context of the wave 
  - Guidance for talking to the customer:
     - Any specific reach out email template
     - What are the recommended customer roles to talk to?
     - Specific information we need from the customer
     - Preferred next action
  - For the Discovery call (delivered by the Reengagement FM), provide:
     - Leading questions for the discovery meeting to open the specific wave conversation
     - Additional material for the discovery meeting to discuss the wave goals and if necessary, schedule a SME meeting (for instance one slide PPTX)
  - For SME meeting (If expected to drive a detailed workload conversation that would be driven by a SME):
     - Specific workload wave scenarios SME needs to focus on
     - What is the specific information the SME needs to collect?
     - All material (such as PPTX) that SME needs to present
     - All feedback that the SME needs to collect
  - Common objection handlers
  - All specific datapoint that need to be collected
  - All specific FTOP requirements (such as completing tasks not in Reengagement scope)
  - Any requirements to update the tools that is not part of standard process

4. Once previous steps are completed, the Workload PM creates a Wave Workload Playbook using this template: [Wave Playbook Template](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ftccm/opsplaybook/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BEA70A1C0-8020-4280-8057-E0F709BDBD59%7D&file=Template%20-%20New%20Wave.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true&cid=f02df762-3acc-465d-9fc6-ae3d7e3abb91). 

5. The process to execute a wave is as follows: 
  - Workload PM provides wave target list to the GRT Lead
  - Workload PM provides the Wave Playbook
  - GRT PM validates list and agrees on final list with Workload PM
  - GRT PM Tag the target list with FY19-Reengagment-<wave name>
  - Score the target list using the [Tenant Targeting](re-engagement-tenant-targeting.md) 
  - If this is a new wave, the Workload PM must:
     - Provide a playbook
     - Provide playbook-specific training
  - GRT PM assign(s) customers to GRT FM’s and proceeds with GRT process.
  - GRT Team reports monthly on progress.
