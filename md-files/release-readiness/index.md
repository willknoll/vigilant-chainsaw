# Overview

This page provides information about our content goals, governance, audience, delivery training, communications, and training. This information is provided for change owners and task owners who need work together to publish readiness content. Readiness content consists of the coordinated efforts of training, communications, and documentation for FastTrack Specialists. Customer training is not in scope.

## Content Goals

- Centralize internal process documentation in GitHub.

- Align standard and partner processes as much as possible.

- Foster integration between cross-functional teams.

- Set expectations for handoffs to avoid duplicate work.

- Benefit from single-sourcing of content.

## Governance

Modularize training and documentation content so that sections can be updated versus updating the entire training.

- When new changes are approved in triage, a VSTS task will be opened for an individual to:
    
    - Check related curriculum impact (add/remove/update role learning path)
    
    - Check related readiness content (e-learning modules, documentation, videos)

## Audiences

### Microsoft Internal

Content is available to Microsoft or Microsoft-badged personnel.

- Communications are posted to the FTC info blog which populates the Announcements section of FTOP.

- Documentation could apply to multiple audiences and is located in GitHub; as part of the Playbook, or as a stand-alone guide.

- Delivery training applies to multiple audiences and is located in Success Factors.

### External

Content is located in the FastTrack Binary Content Manager (BCM).
