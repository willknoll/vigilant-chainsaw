# Partner Documentation

## Overview

This page provides guidelines for change owners who want their content published on GitHub.

### Timeline

Final content must be received from change owner no later than 10 business days before release date to allow for content development, review, and publishing. Content must be committed by partner technical writer to GitHub by 3:00 PM PT three days prior to bi-monthly release dates (2nd and 4th Friday).

### Process

**FTOP Partner Guide**, customer ready CIs are received through the Readiness meetings and through [https://o365fasttrack.visualstudio.com/Program%20Management](https://o365fasttrack.visualstudio.com/Program%20Management)

- Change owner lets partner technical writer know when the change is available in FTOP UAT.

- Partner technical writer will contact change owner with questions and to obtain approval on the accuracy of the content before it is published.

**FastTrack Playbook** (Partner Version of Playbook), content changes are received through the Readiness meetings, Julie and Wendy manage the review of potential customer ready CIs.

- Change owner lets partner technical writer know when the change is available in Playbook.

- Internal FastTrack Playbook team and Partner Playbook team collaborate on changes.

**FRP Team Channel**, FPM and FRP request additional documentation and resources through the team channel. These types of requests are triaged by Patric, then Patric and Celia prioritize the requests.

- Celia contacts change owners to receive content for posting (decks, Yammer posts, webinars, and postings for external content hosted on Partner site, Partners may create a YouTube video appropriate to share on other partner sites.) This type of request includes content not published on GitHub.

**Email requests** content owners may request updates directly, when that happens they are asked to submit an issue through Azure DevOps.
