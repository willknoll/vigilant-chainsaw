# Customer-ready Documentation

## Customer-ready Documentation (Office Files)

### Overview

Customer-ready documentation is content that's shared with customers (like PowerPoint decks). Final content must be received no later than 2 weeks (10 business days) before the release date to allow for content review. **Content received after this date may be pushed to the following release cadence.**

### Requirements

#### Voice and Style

- All customer-ready documentation must adhere to the [FastTrack Style Guide](../contribute/contribute-fasttrack-style-guide-goals.md).

- All customer-ready documentation must adhere to the [Microsoft Style Guides](https://styleguides.azurewebsites.net), [Microsoft Terminology Studio](https://termstudio.azurewebsites.net), and [Microsoft Brand Central](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/BrandCentral).

- All customer-ready documentation must be localized in languages FastTrack supports.

- The Readiness team:

    -  Handles the handoff to and from the localization vendor.

    -  Uploads the English and localized files into the Binary Content Manager (BCM), the content repository used for customer-ready documentation.

    - Creates landing pages where the content can be accessed and retrieved.

#### Localization

- Lionbridge is our localization vendor. They also localize the customer-facing FastTrack site owned by the FastTrack product marketing group. Lionbridge:

    - Uses human translators, not machines.

    - Leverages translation memories. This means the first time content is localized, the cost is higher. Subsequent localizations usually cost less given the translation memories (scope of change depending).

- All customer-ready documentation must be localized in Traditional Chinese and Simplified Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Thai, and Vietnamese.

    - Migration-specific content is localized in a subset of these languages (not including Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese).

#### File Requirements

Files have the following requirements:

- The file names must adhere to the file naming conventions for the BCM.

    - Before files are posted to the BCM, they must meet hygiene requirements, including having no hidden slides, change logs, or instructions/guidelines specific to FastTrack personnel in either the slide body or Notes section of the slides.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information, see [How to use the FastTrack Binary Content Management (BCM) web app](../contribute/contribute-how-to-use-bcm.md). 

 - Use the appropriate language-code preface (en-us, de-de, etc.).

 - No references to "FTC" or "FastTrack" can be in the file name.
