# Global Readiness Session

## Overview

- Global readiness sessions are ideal for trainings longer than 20 minutes and for trainings that require significant Q&A sessions.

- Global readiness sessions are available Monday and Tuesday of most weeks.

- Change owner, or their designee, presents the training live during each of the three scheduled global readiness training sessions (EMEA, APJ, Americas).

- Global readiness sessions are recorded by change owner and the recordings are then published to the Nexus Learning Catalog, by the readiness team.

- Readiness team dev time for global readiness training is 3-5 hours once MP4 recording is received.

### Scheduling Global Readiness Teams session

If a change requires more than 15-20 minutes of training or extended Q\&A, the change owner may choose to offer a training live during the pre-defined global readiness teams training slots outlined below. The change owner records the training so that it can be added to Nexus Learning Catalog. The change owner may also supplement the live training with an on-demand E-learning module. Change owner must provide online training via MS Teams at least 10 business days prior to release.

Global readiness teams training slots are:

- EMEA: Mondays, 7 OR 8 AM PST

- APJ: Tuesdays, 7 or 8 PM PST

- Americas: Tuesdays, 7 AM PST

These dates are assigned on a first come, first served basis and may be limited due to in-country holidays or other scheduled meetings.

### Creating Global Readiness Session

- Change owner completes the training details and request form, located at [FTCTD](https://aka.ms/FTCTD).

    - Link the completed request form to the VSTS task and @mention [FTCReadiness](mailto:FTCReadiness@microsoft.com), notifying the readiness team the form is complete.

- Change owner links the completed details form to the VSTS task and @mentions [FTCReadiness](mailto:FTCReadiness@microsoft.com). Include in the @mention that you are requesting a global readiness training time slot, and provide the desired week.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Global readiness training sessions must be completed no later than the first week of the desired release month.

- Global training coordinator confirms training date with global leads. Once the date is confirmed, global leads will invite all parties.

- Change owner records the readiness session and sends the MP4 recording to the global training coordinator.

> [!NOTE]
> Global readiness team cannot accept the Stream location for publication.
