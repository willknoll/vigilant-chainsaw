# E-learning module

## Overview

- E-learning modules are interactive learning experiences or embedded video presentations that learners complete for each curriculum area.

- E-learning modules are ideal for trainings less than 20 minutes long. These modules are reusable, updatable, and trackable.

- E-learning module content is provided by the change owner to the readiness team. An instructional designer develops and publishes the training module, with review support from the content owner.

- E-learning modules include knowledge assessments that help drive home key learning objectives. Learners must achieve a score of 85% in order to receive credit for completing the course. Knowledge assessments may also be standalone tests that check understanding of content presented in an in-person or online training.

- E-learning modules are available on-demand from the Learning Management System.

- Readiness team development time for E-learning module is approximately 40-60 hours, depending on available content and length of training.
 
### Scheduling E-learning module

To ensure that an E-learning module is available by release date, the following prerequisites must be met:

- CMR must be approved 15 business days before the FTC info blog is published. The latest triage falls on the 20th of the prior month.

- Content from change owner must be available to the readiness team 15 days prior to when the FTC info blog is published. Ideally, content should be available the day after the CMR is approved.

- Change owner must adhere to established review schedule in order for content to be delivered on time.

### Creating E-learning module

- Change owner completes the relevant sections of the Readiness Training Details form, located at [FTCTD](https://aka.ms/FTCTD).

   - Link the completed request form to VSTS task and @mention [FTCReadiness](mailto:FTCReadiness@microsoft.com), notifying them the form is complete.

- FTC readiness training lead PM assigns training to instructional designer and notifies change owner of the assignment.

- Instructional designer begins development, working with change owner to identify gaps in information or resolve open issues.

- Instructional designer sends first draft for review. Change owner is responsible for identifying reviewers and compiling review feedback. Unless otherwise coordinated with instructional designer, review feedback is due back within 3 business days.

- Change owner returns review feedback to instructional designer.

   - Instructional designer incorporates review comments and sends completed module to change owner for final review.

   - Unless otherwise coordinated, final review comments are due back within 2 business days.

- Instructional designer publishes completed module and sends link for inclusion in change communication.
