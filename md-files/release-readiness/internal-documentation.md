# Internal Documentation

## Overview

This page provides guidelines for change owners who would like to get their content published on GitHub.

### Timeline

Final content must be received from change owner no later than 10 business days before release date to allow for content development, review, and publishing. Content must be committed by readiness technical writer to GitHub by 3:00 PM PT two days prior to release date.

## Process

For internal readiness content and FTOP User Guide updates, follow the instructions below:

- Change owner attaches completed draft to the associated child task in *Documentation: Create/Update internal-facing content*.

- Change owner attaches completed draft to the associated child task in *Documentation: Update FTOP User Guide*.

    - Change owner provides location of source materials (functional specs, design documents, prototype images shared location)

    - Change owner lets readiness technical writer know when the change is available in FTOP UAT.

- Readiness technical writer will contact change owner and schedule a meeting for questions and to obtain approval before the content is published.

### Requirements

- Not in scope for internal content are playbook processes, steps, and FTOP tasks.

- Content currently produced in Word must be converted to MD for publication in GitHub.

- Office content that exists today in the FTOP document library will remain there until the document library is migrated. Net new internal content should be part of the playbook process steps or published in GitHub.

- All internal content must adhere to [FastTrack Style Guide](../contribute/contribute-fasttrack-style-guide-goals.md).
