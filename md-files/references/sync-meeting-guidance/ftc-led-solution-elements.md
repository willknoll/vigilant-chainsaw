# FTC-Led Solution Elements

The elements for a productive FTC-Led solution meeting include:

## Inputs

- Any pre-requisites needed to be prepared or reviewed by attendees
- An up-to-date, relevant agenda, sent at least 1 day before the meeting
- Confirmation from key attendees that they will attend

## Meeting structure

- Agenda – A clearly defined and current set of objectives for the meeting
- Stakeholder identification – Who needs to be present? What are their roles? Will they have decisions and/or actions to own?
- Next steps – Time allowed to articulate the owners, issues, actions, and timelines for completion

## Activities & best practice

- Agenda owner – Clear guidance on who owns the meeting (FM, FE, Customer, etc.)
- Communications – Guidance regarding meeting reminders
- Timekeeping
- Assign a note-taker

## Outputs

- Notes – Structured notes from the meeting
- Actions – Documented actions and owners for all people required (i.e. not simply the one next action)
- Issues – Documented issues with owners and timelines for expected resolution
- Updated Target Date for workload enablement (if it changes)

The next topic will help you plan your agenda.
