# Agenda

Having a clear agenda can make for a highly effective meeting. From the Harvard Business Review's article: [How to Create the Perfect Meeting Agenda](https://hbr.org/2020/02/how-to-create-the-perfect-meeting-agenda), that while there's "little to no relationship between the presence of an agenda and attendees' evaluation of meeting quality, what matters is not the agenda itself but the relevance and importance of what's on it, and how the leader facilitates discussion of the agenda items."

The important factors here are the both the relevance of the agenda to the attendees and the way the leader facilitates the meeting based on it.

## Plan your agenda

While there are no set rules for what makes for the right agenda in all cases, there are some guidelines:

1. Put the most important items first – Agenda items at the start of a meeting get the most attention. Make sure you have the most important items first so you know those things will be addressed in the meeting, even if you run out of time
2. Assign a lead to each item – The meeting facilitator doesn't have to lead each agenda topic. By putting a name to each agenda item, it becomes clear who's on point to drive that part of the meeting, the outcomes, and next steps.
3. Stick with the agenda – It's common for other topics to spring up during a meeting. The facilitator should work to stick to the agenda since those are the things you gathered to address. However, you shouldn't ignore those items. There are two things you can do:
   a. Create a "Parking Lot" of items to be discussed in a subsequent meeting
   b. Address the item in the moment
4. To decide which tactic to use, ask the group: "Do we want to address this now or take it as an item for another meeting?"

>[!NOTE]
>If a new topic is being discussed because the team agrees to, you should get agreement that you will either extend the time of the meeting to cover the rest of the agenda or move agenda items to another meeting.

1. Allow for time to capture outcomes – This should always be part of your agenda. That way, all participants are aware of and agree to decisions made and things accomplished.
2. Allow for time to capture next steps – This should always be part of your agenda. That way, all participants can feel invested in what comes next.
3. Consider assigning timeframes to each agenda item – Assigning a timeframe to each agenda item gives all attendees an understanding of how long to spend on each item.

The next topic provides you a sample agenda you can adapt for your sync meeting.
