# Overview

## Audience

FastTrack Manager (FM), FastTrack Engineer (FE), and Subject Matter Expert (SME)

## Summary

This article discusses issues that occur in sync meetings and provides tips and guidance for how you can proactively address these issues.

## Problem statement

Generally, nearly 80% of the calls we observe in QA are "sync" meetings. These meetings are loosely structured and not clearly aligned to any Playbook process/step.

Part of the issue lies in the fact that the "Assist with Enablement" step simply says "Conduct sync meetings with customer as appropriate and assist with enablement tasks." The Quality Team has identified the top five positive conformance attributes of these sync meetings were related to meeting "hygiene".

As a result of this lack of structure, notes captured in FTOP are not consistent with agenda, actions, owners, issues, etc.

Also, the Quality team tracks meeting cancellations and the main reason that meetings are canceled is related to customers not seeing the value in having the meeting. Without clear agendas and actions, this will continue.
