# Guidelines

## Services in scope

All services in scope for FastTrack assistance are eligible to be surveyed, though there are no service specific questions.

## Eligible customers

Surveys may be sent to active customers at multiple points in their engagement with FastTrack.
Currently, customers are eligible to receive surveys if the following criteria are met:

- Active customers with an overall status notes update within the previous 60 days

- Customer contact is marked as “Survey Eligible” in the FTOP Contacts field

- All other survey eligibility validation is complete: Language, Country and Service(s) Deployed/Migrated.

## Survey timelines

The survey timeline is variable but should follow the outline below very closely. With the change to a phase-based survey approach, the process will be weekly with a single phase per week, i.e.. The first week of the month will be Planning Phase surveys, second week will be Enablement/Deployment Phase, and so on such that each phase is surveyed at least once per month.

- **NLT Tuesdays (AM East Coast, UTC-5)**: Survey validation will be posted in the FY 20 CPE Teams channel and individual FM's will be notified via email for customers to be surveyed.

- **Wednesdays (6pm Pacific, UTC-8)**: Validated surveys will be sent via email from Qualtrics. Survey@userresearch.microsoft.com is the sending address. A direct web link can be furnished on request if customers have difficulty receiving the survey.

Surveys links will automatically expire after one-month if customer contact does not complete and submit his/her response. A separate email reminder will be sent two weeks before the survey expires to remind customer to complete questions.
