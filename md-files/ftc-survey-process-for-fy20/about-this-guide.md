# About This Guide

## Survey objective

The FastTrack Center (FTC) periodically surveys customer contacts who led customer onboarding and adoption engagements on their FastTrack experience. The objective of the surveys is to:

1. Capture feedback and sentiment around the customer’s experience with FastTrack during the onboarding of intended services; and

1. Understand their willingness to recommend FastTrack services to others.

These factors are primarily captured by two qualitative questions that ask:

- **Customer/Partner Experience (CPE)** –  “Please rate your overall experience with FastTrack?”

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** – “Based on your experience with FastTrack, how likely are you to use or purchase additional Microsoft Products and Services?”

The CPE is based on a 5 point scale, with 5 being “Highly Satisfied” or “Highly Likely” and 1 being “Highly Dissatisfied” or “Not Likely at All”. The NPS question uses the same criteria on a 10 point scale.

Further information on the full list of survey questions can be found in [Survey Questions](survey-questions.md).

## Survey approach

The survey delivery process is automated by using triggers and contact information from FTOP. There are two ways that a tenant may be sent a survey: **Phase-based** and **Reactive**

- **Phase-based (FY20H2)** - Survey eligibility is based on active customer engagements (customers with overall status notes updated within the 60 days prior to survey). Selection criteria may vary in FY20H2 as baselines are established for FY21.

- **Reactive (FY19 and FY20H1 process)** - Survey eligibility based on FM identification of customers.
