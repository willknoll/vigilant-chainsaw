# Survey Tasks

## Overview

The survey process is changing for FY20 H2. It is now no longer necessary for FastTrack Managers (FM's) to initiate the sending of a survey. FM's should identify a survey eligible contact for each active engagement during the Kickoff Meeting and update the FTOP contact details with the associated customer’s language, country, and workload(s) to be surveyed (see screenshot below). This information is needed to ensure the right survey is sent and the associated email language meets GDPR requirements. If a customer contact name is not listed, please add.

> [!NOTE]
> A validation error message will show up if the FM tries to save the survey eligible field change, when the language, country, or services deployed/migrated field is still missing information.

## Initiate survey notifications

Primary FMs will be sent an email notifying them when a survey is planned for delivery. They will be given a few days to respond with any changes. A second email notification will be sent when the survey is delivered to the customer.

## Identify survey contact: FTOP Task 3690

Currently, **FTOP Task 3690** provides guidance around how to designate a customer contact as “survey-eligible”. We need this information to ensure the right surveys get sent to the correct customer contacts. We’ll use a report to track progress against this task.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is in the best interest of the Delivery Teams to ensure the right customer contact is selected and the FTOP assignments are correct. Otherwise, surveys may go out with the wrong assignments attached.

Sub Task ID:** 3690
