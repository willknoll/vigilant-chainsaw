# Overview

This article is for users who need to manage their own, and their direct-reports, access to FastTrack Reporting (FTR), also known as FastTrack Power BI. If you have questions or concerns reach out to FTMyAccess.

Access to FTR is available to certain vendors and full-time employees that work to deliver FastTrack Center (FTC) benefits to our Microsoft 365 customers. Access is requested and managed using the [MyAccess](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/itweb/Identity/MyAccess/Pages/Overview.aspx) web portal operated by Microsoft Core Services Engineering and Operations (CSEO) and is supported by the Microsoft [Global Helpdesk](https://microsoft.service-now.com/sp?id=call).

## MyAccess primer

MyAccess is a web tool that manages your membership in security groups (SG) that live in Microsoft Corp’s Active Directory. The creator of a MyAccess Project configures rules that automate workflows that govern who gets to join the project’s SGs; as well as how long you get to remain in the SGs; who’s approval you need to join the SGs; etc.

MyAccess’s governance philosophy is that access will be revoked automatically if you do not take periodic action to maintain your membership in the project's SG. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Email reminders, automatically sent from MyAccess, is how you are instructed to renew your membership, as well as how approvers are notified and instructed to approve or decline requests.
