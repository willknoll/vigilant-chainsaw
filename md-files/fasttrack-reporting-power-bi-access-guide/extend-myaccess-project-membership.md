# Extend MyAccess Project Membership

## Overview

When your project access approaches its expiration date, you will be notified by email that your access is about to expire. The notification shows you the name of the project, the permission level, and when access is scheduled to expire.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not renew and your access expires, you will need to start the process over.

The following screen shows an example of the expiration notice.

Project access can be renewed at any time, but the extension period is based on the renewal date. For example, if you renew 30 days into your 90-day renewal period your new expiration date will still be 90 days. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you do not renew and your access expires, you will need to start the process over.
