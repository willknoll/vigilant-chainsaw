# Is my feedback an FTC Insight?
- If the feedback is on workload functionality and without it the customer will be unable to deploy (partially or entirely) OR is process related specific to a workload 
  <br>**This is an FTC Insight**

- If this a question about workload functionality or scope of the FastTrack benefit for the workload 
  <br>**This is a question for the workload channel in the [FastTrack – M365](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a811961642e6a401b81e82b90b400a3e5%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=4be32c1a-84cf-43d6-b8a2-9986a996b0a5&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) Teams site (FEs should use the [COLLAB Channel](https://aka.ms/ftcollab) for technical questions**

- If the question or ask requires deep technical and/or deployment guidance which is workload specific for customer engagement and is expected to take longer than an hour to resolve
  <br>**This is a [SME Request](https://aka.ms/ftcsmerequestprocess)**

- If the question or ask is about an FTC tool (i.e. FTOP), reporting data, or general FTC processes (non-workload specific)
  <br>**This is an [FTCHelp request](https://aka.ms/ftchelp)**

- If the question or ask is about any part of the Playbook (guidance for planning, deployment, and adoption)
  <br>**This is [Playbook Feedback](https://aka.ms/ftplaybookfeedback)**

- If a feature already implemented in the product isn’t working as documented or expected (i.e. error message or exception experienced)
  <br>**This is a Support request**

- If the feedback is about something a customer would like to see changed in the product but it is not affecting their ability to deploy (i.e. Admin UI, nice to have functionality)
  <br>**This is a DCR (for Premier customers) *or* a UserVoice entry (search UserVoice sites)**

## CSS Technical Support
Intended to be used for deployed workloads when functionality does not work as advertised or an error/exception occurs that is unexpected.
- Raised if **basic troubleshooting** fails to resolve a customer issue (typically about an hour on a best effort basis). Premier customers should open cases under their contract.
- Customers who request **Design Changes** that reflect purely their organization’s needs. TAM’s will assist with the process, starts with a case.
- Alternatively, **UserVoice** sites can be leveraged for non-blocking product functionality asks to the product group.
