| **Tier 2 Triage Team**<br> (CXP, OPS PMs, SME + PG, other Stakeholders)<br>  *Statuses: Escalated + Assigned + Building Impact* | - Triages the entries based on whether the item is within the scope of the FTC Insights process, has the correct impact for escalation, possible business impact, and/or by importance.<br> - If the item is a valuable FTC Insight but more detail is required before escalation can take place, the item will be assigned an owner for follow up with the submitter and the status will be updated to *Assigned*.<br> - If the item is a valuable FTC Insight but the customer impact is below the Feature Engineering Team's escalation threshold the status of the item will be updated to *Building Impact*. If the required escalation threshold has not been met within 6 months the item will be retired and status updated to *Closed (Low Impact)*.<br> - Once an item is approved for elevation by Tier 2 the status of the item will be updated to *Pending Resolution*. |
