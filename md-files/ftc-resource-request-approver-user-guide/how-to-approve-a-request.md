# How to Approve a Request

Once a request is submitted you can find it in the [Management Portal](https://aka.ms/ftcreqmanagement):

Review newly submitted requests on a first in, first out basis. Select the preferred view for triage, either FTC Triage or FRP Triage in the view selector in the left upper corner:

You may filter by Region or POD as necessary. Double-click the request to open it. Once the request is open, you have access to all the details provided by the requestor:
