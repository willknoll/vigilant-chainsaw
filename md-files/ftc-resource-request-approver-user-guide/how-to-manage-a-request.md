- One workload or an entire suite (e.g., O365, EMS) per request

- Ability to ask for an FM or FE resource assignment

- Ability to ask for an onsite resource approval

- Send out applicable notifications to submitter based on submission and or status update (e.g., approve/reject decision)

## Request Statuses

The tool provide four statuses for triaging of requests:
