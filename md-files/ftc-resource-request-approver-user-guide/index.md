# Overview

A new Resource request tool has been created to replace the current tool in Nexus. The objective of this tool is to enable consistent submission and tracking of the different resources requested for assignment to customer engagement and/or partner.  

The new Resource request tool can be found here:

- FTC: [ftcresourcerequest](https://aka.ms/ftcreqmanagement) and [ftcfereq](https://aka.ms/ftcfereq)
- FRP: [frpsmerequest](https://aka.ms/frpsmerequest)

The Approvers portal for managing requests can be found here:
