# FTCSME Bot User Guide

## Chatting with FTCSME Bot

The bot is designed to answer a set of predefined questions in a conversational way. Given the limited set of questions the bot can answer, we welcome feedback on areas where we can improve coverage. See [Feedback](feedback.md).

Currently the bot can handle a set of general migration questions, where to find additional information for various topics, and FastTrack procedures. Example questions are:

- What release options are available in office 365?
- Find deployment guidance for ProPlus?
- How long is onboarding engagement?
- Where can I find cloud architecture resources?
- What's included in office365?
- How does a FastTrack engagement work?
- Deployment guide for teams?

### Help

To get additional guidance directly from the bot you can type "help" to see examples of questions.
