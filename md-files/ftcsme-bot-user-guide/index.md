# FTCSME Bot User Guide

## Overview

This article discusses finding, chatting with, and providing feedback for the FTCSME Bot, released in February 2020. The bot is designed to help address common questions which previously required a response from a SME. The goal is to provide consistent responses to commonly asked questions - allowing you to get answers to your customers faster resulting in improved efficiency, saving time, and helping customers get guidance quickly.
